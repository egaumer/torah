# _Mishpatim_ &sdot; משפטים
Parashah 18 &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; _Rulings (_ 21:1&mdash;24:18 _)_

The Torah contains more than the ten commandments. This portion of the Torah contains fifty of the total [613 commands](https://www.jewfaq.org/613_commandments). Immediately after speaking the ten commandments from Mount Sinai, God gave Moses a series of laws called _Mishpatim_ (מִשְׁפָּט)<sup>[H4941](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4941/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H$($!)")</sup>, “judgments,” which form the foundations and case presidents for the practice of Torah law. 

The title _Mishpatim_ comes from the first words of the first verse of the reading, which could literally be translated to say, `“And these are the judgments which you will place before them”` (Exodus 21:1). This portion will contain many laws on a wide variety of subjects including: employment law regarding the treatment of servants, murder, manslaughter, liability for one’s animals, theft, rape, dowry, idolatry and sorcery and many others. Remember that Jesus summed up all these laws with “Love God and Love Man.”

&nbsp;

The laws of Exodus 21 are among the most controversial of the Old Testament laws. People have asked, “Why would you worship a God who allows Israel to keep slaves?” We are going to look at rules and regulations from a standpoint of the God principle they embody. Each of these laws and regulations cover various aspects of social justice, personal injury, and property rights in ancient Israelite society. But they are also valid principles for us. Yep, even in 2023!

Exodus 21:2-6: The law of Hebrew servants. This chapter begins with the most difficult laws to grapple with- The laws of slavery. In North America, our collective memory of slavery is ugly. People were kidnapped, maltreated, bought and sold, subjugated to all sorts of cruelties and denied basic human dignities. We have to look at this law as it was intended: to prevent exploitation. 

We must remember that Israel had just left slavery. They experienced it in its ugliest form. God is going to deal with the elephant in the room and talk first about maltreatment of slaves. All of the Bible’s laws about slaves are meant for the protection and well-being of the people enslaved. You can compare this to an abusive home where the son is beaten by the father. When he grows up, he beats his own children because he learned to parent from his father. The Bible’s laws of slavery are meant to break that pattern of mistreatment of another human being, and bring compassion and protection for the vulnerable. These are going to be brand new concepts to the recently freed slaves. So why would they need a slave in the first place? There are laws against kidnapping, laws against the slave trade, so what is this about?

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>How did the experience of slavery shape the laws that were given to the Israelites?

&nbsp;

We must also remember that the realization that servanthood in the ancient world was a real and normal part of the economy. There was no standard of currency. People didn’t work jobs like we do. If you were a land owner you most likely had people you hired to help work the land. For the landless lower-class, servitude was an attractive option. It mean learning new skills, employment and food and shelter for the person and his dependents. In most societies, slaves had no rights. The Torah changed that. 

If we equated slaves in Biblical times to our current economy, the Torah would have us treat employees fairly, with dignity and with a worthy compensation. This law was a social safety net for someone at the point of desperation. They were provided an opportunity to work, but there were boundaries to how that was overseen. 

In the entire ancient world there were people who worked for others as servants. They were slaves in some sense, though not necessarily in the brutal and degraded sense most think of slavery. Just a note: slavery existed long before Israel or Moses. The Bible is responsible for the elimination of slavery, not its establishment. 

The word slave and servant is the same word in Hebrew. There’s no distinction, so they were permitted to have servants. Typically they were servants of other nations. For example, if another country would attack Israel the Israel won the battle, the people that lost the battle would become servants of that kingdom. That's the way it was in ancient times. 

If you were Hebrew, you couldn’t have a Hebrew servant unless- that person was so poor and needed to pay off debt. Then he would work for you in a servant-master relationship for 6 years. After 6 years, he would be set free- with his debt paid off. It would be similar to going to a restaurant and not being able to pay the bill, so you wash dishes to pay for the food. That's what some of these laws are talking about. 

Servants in the Old Testament were chosen or mutually arranged, of limited duration, and highly regulated. If all of theabove instances, the servitude was never to be life-long. The Hebrew servant worked for 6 years and then was set free.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>Can you think of examples from the passage that show how the laws protected the well-being of the people enslaved?

&nbsp;

This is a 6-1 pattern that God has set up. You work 6 years, then are free the 7th year. It's the pattern of the Sabbath. You work six days, then on the seventh, you rest. This also works for their crops. They plant and harvest for six years, then on the seventh year, the land takes a Sabbatical. 

Interestingly, the nation of Israel failed to keep this Sabbatical year for their land, that lasted a period of 490 years. That’s why God took the children out of Israel, out of the land, into a foreign land for 70 Sabbath years. They were Babylonian captivity because they disobeyed keeping the law of the land, and after their captivity, they came back. 

The concept of 6-1 is interesting, as the Jewish year currently (as of May 2023) is 5783 -almost 6,000 years since they say the creation of Adam and Eve. The world has been under the servitude of the devil for almost 6,000 years. We're coming up on the seventh millennium. It's interesting and fascinating, but I have nothing to base it on other than patterns. 

Now if the servant worked for six years and wanted to stay because they developed a good relationship with the master, it would change from servant to bondservant. The servant is a servant because he has to. But he can become a bondservant because he wants to. This is a voluntary situation, not coerced. 

When Christians talk about “the law," we ordinarily think of lists of rules of do's and don’ts. Some Christian teachers seem to view the laws of the Torah as if they are a bad thing. It is commonly taught that the law is the opposite of grace. I’m sure you’re heard someone say, “We are no longer under the law. We are under grace.” This implies that because of Jesus, we do not need to concern ourselves with the laws in the Old Testament.

&nbsp;

Does it mean we do not have to keep God’s laws? For example, does it mean that we can commit adultery and theft? Of course not. No one would say that. 

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> The Sanctity of Life: Exodus 21:7-11

&nbsp;

Again, as we read this passage as modern readers, this feels wrong. Why is a man selling his daughter? Feels icky, right? 

After slaves, God addresses women’s rights. The sanctity of life is so important to God that He listed the crimes of man against man that would degrade Israelite society in general. Parts of this list of capital crimes are expected, some are surprising. _Yhwh_ lists the seriousness of... 

* Premeditated murder 
* Attacking and harming (not necessarily killing) your parents 
* Kidnapping (whether the victim is harmed or not) 
* Cursing your parents. 

All of these deserved the death penalty. God offered no mercy for these perpetrators, nor did he offer any possibility of rehabilitation. 

For the daughter, there seems to be a marriage involved because the father is selecting her for his son. We must put ourselves into this ancient culture where marriages were arranged by the father. Every marriage had a bride price. There is a financial transaction, but it does not make this slavery (as we see it from our modern lens). 

There are two exchanges of money: one is the dowry- which goes with the daughter. It is meant to support her if anything goes wrong, or if the marriage doesn’t last. It is hers. Then there is the bride price. That goes to the family to support them because they just lost a working member in their family. In this instance, there is poverty and the man does not have a dowry for his daughter, and he cannot provide for her anymore. So he is allowing her to join that household as a wife with no dowry. This is not about selling off the daughter to get a little income. The father is looking for a husband for her, but has found someone to take her without a dowry. There is a financial exchange, but not in both directions. She won’t be leaving like the male servants, because she will be married. It’s a little different. And she cannot be traded around from partner to partner. In those days, the husband cannot pay the bride price and then if he doesn’t like her, sell her to someone else. She has to go back to the family of origin and be redeemed. The bride price is so the family would have the money to redeem her back. This daughter would have all the dignity of a member of the family. 

Foundational principles of all these laws are: equity, respect, protection of the vulnerable, value of life, justice, accountability, honor, value of the family, maintaining social order, freedom, human dignity, restitution, and compassion.

Exodus 21:17 The law of cursing parents. This law is similar to verse 15. Once again, God is emphasizing the important of respecting parents and honoring them. What does it mean to “curse” your parents? It is in the sense of a son insulting or being an embarrassment to his parents because they are of no account. It would include his not caring for them if they needed his help. A son who humiliated his parents by his behavior, who showed his parents disrespect, or who was simply a deadbeat should be put to death according to Yahweh’s law. God saw this as guarding life, because the people who do these things steal life from those whom _Yhwh_ sees as innocent and upright.

In God's eyes, the intention of a person’s heart has everything to do with the consequences of his or her actions. The idea of an eye for an eye, tooth for tooth, etc. (vs 24) is not literal. It is about compensation. According to the Torah, the death penalty is only used when the taking of human life is intentional. Mutilation was not a permitted punishment. 

Just a side note: Islam follows Allah's instructions when they mutilate the offenders of the Islamic Sharia law. They cut off hands, fingers, feet, tongues, etc. Islam loves to claim that Christians, Hebrews, and Muslims all share the same god, but the Bible teaches against such things while the Koran, the Muslim holy book, commands mutilations. Just further proof that Allah is not another culture’s name for _Yhwh_. 

The law of God isn’t just to govern our outward actions, but our inward attitudes. It’s all a matter of the heart. We need a redeemer. The word “redeemer” literally means to buy a slave back from the slave market. The law cannot do that. It cannot redeem you. 

Maybe you’re a rule follower. You say that you keep the Ten Commandments. Really? How about lying and rest? Jesus said “If you’re angry with your brother, you have committed murder. If you lust, you’ve committed adultery” and on and on. It’s inward, not just outward. It’s not about the law, it’s about the LORD of the law. How is your relationship with Him? 

When Jesus talks in the Sermon on the Mount, He’s not raising the bar on the Ten Commandments. He’s reading them as a heart issue, not a legal issue. Obviously, you can’t legislate if someone covet’s his neighbor’s house. It’s a heart issue. The Pharisees were so intent on keeping to the letter of the law (tithing 10% of their spices), that they missed the entire point. What Jesus is proposing is actually harder, and more comprehensive than the Ten Commandments!

# Day 2 &middot; _Protecting the Innocent_

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 22

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 2 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>How does the law in Exodus 22 address the issue of theft and property protection?

&nbsp;

Exodus 21 dealt mainly with offenses that involved physical injury, mainly to people. Exodus 22 will deal with offenses involving property. 

Laws are much more than a list of dos and don’ts. They are an example of the value system of a society. The law is a set of standards that points us to the solution. It modifies our behavior. That’s all it can do. It can never rectify our character. All it can do is point us to Christ. The law does one thing- reveals that we are sinners. 

There is a legal code that predates Moses’ Law by 400 years. It is the Babylonian code of Hammurabi. These two codes are often compared because of the ancient cultures. When Hammurabi speaks of thieves, the law demands that they be put to death. The law of Moses, however, is one of the more merciful codes in the ancient world. It requires that the thief pay back 4-5 fold. 

Many people say, “Oh, the God of the Old Testament is vengeful and full of wrath and anger. The New Testament God is all about love.” 

I beg to differ. The Old Testament God has not changed. He has been seeking to protect the innocent from the beginning. 

Remember Zacchaeus in Luke 19? He was the little guy who climbed the sycamore tree to see Jesus. When he was convicted of his sin he said he would pay them back fourfold. Did you think he was just being a nice guy? He was referring to this law, the law of compensation. 

Farm animals were vital sources of income for Israelite families. A thief is required to payback 4-5-fold, but is not given the death penalty (unless he steals at night- in which case the home owner would not know if he was coming to steal and kill).

Verse 2- If a thief is caught breaking in at night and is struck a fatal blow, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed. It is assumed that if the thief is breaking in a night, he intends to do more than steal. It is not considered murder if the owner kills him. This law was for protecting your property and self-protection. 

God gives some rights to criminals, but he does not override the rights of the victims. 

Verse 16 is the first of the miscellaneous laws against sexual promiscuity. “If a man seduces a virgin who is not pledged to be married and sleeps with her, he must pay the bride-price, and she shall be his wife.”

This is speaking of premarital sex. If a young man and young woman get together, and their hormones are raging and the young man seduces the young woman to have sex, the solution is they get married. It doesn’t say if she’s pregnant. They have already consummated the relationship. He is to go find her dad and pay the dowry as if they were getting married… because they are. If the dad says, “Stay away from my daughter, you creep.” The young man is still stuck with the dowry. If she becomes his wife, he pays the dowry. What's the message? You play, you pay…either way. Many people are adamantthat the Bible doesn't talk about premarital sex. It’s clear by this scripture that it does.

&nbsp;

Verse 18- the Old Testament strongly condemns dabbling in the occult. It runs counter to serving the Lord alone. There is no difference Biblically between black magic (intending to harm someone) or white magic (bringing good luck). It was all forbidden. 

Verse 19- Having intercourse with an animal was a feature of animal cults and fertility worship. Such activities were strictly forbidden by God. Why is this even mentioned?! Because the Canaanites practiced it. Mesopotamians practiced it.

In 1992, an American named Mark Matthews married his horse. In 2005, an American man ordained with the “Universal Life Church” married humans and their pets. And, unfortunately, these are not isolated circumstances. I looked up the Universal Life Church and discovered that their doctrine is: “Do that which is right.” Um…right for whom? Right by God? Hardly. 

Idolatry, in verse 20, became the greatest temptation for the children of Israel. Why? Because everyone around them was doing it. It's all about peer pressure. Why do Christians struggle with certain things that the world struggles with? Because everybody is practicing it. What does the world believe that we should be thinking differently? The idea of separation is not as strong as it should be in our hearts. It's a temptation for us as well.

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 20:8-10 and 23:1-13

&nbsp;

The Fourth Commandment gets revisited in this chapter. There are five things we need to notice: 

1. Remember. First, Israel is to remember the Sabbath day. Don't work on this day. 
2. Keep it holy. This means to set it aside from all other days and keep it to the Lord. The message is clear, this is not about just lounging around with nothing to do. This day should be focused on God. 
3. This day should be one out of every 7 days. Work six, rest one. Work six, rest one. That’s the pattern. 
4. You can’t fool God. You can't say, “Well, I won't work, but I'll have my people work for me while I rest.” God says, no. Your business, employees, servants, even your animals need a rest. 
5. Follow God’s example. Genesis 2:2-3 says that God rested on the 7th day. Do you think that's because God was tired? He 
was setting an example for us of how the value of rest. 

In Exodus 23:10-13, God is using the _Sabbath_ (שַׁבָּת)<sup>[H7676](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7676/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H7676")</sup> law to set up a welfare program. For six years the farmers will sow their land and gather the produce. But on the seventh year they are to let the land rest so that the poor people and wildlife may eat. In God’s economy, like with the manna, there will be enough for everyone on that 7th portion. Even the land gets a _Shabbat_ (שַׁבָּת)<sup>[H7676](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7676/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H7676")</sup>, a rest.

&nbsp;

In Deuteronomy 5 we get the Ten Commandments again. Here's what’s happened: the first generation of Hebrews died in the desert. The second generation is now alive. They are on the plains of Moab, about to enter the Promised Land. Moses is old, and will die after this book (**spoiler alert). So Moses is going to recap the law to a new generation. 

Moses tells this new generation of Israelites in Deuteronomy 5:12, `"Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the Lord your God has commanded you.”` Do me a favor, in this passage (verses 12-15), count how many times God says the word “you” or “your”.

God is getting personal with them. God is saying, “I am asking you, my people, to do these things because I care for you!”. God cares about you! As slaves, the Israelites worked 24/7. God is setting up a different rhythm for this community. The Sabbath is rooted in the pattern of creation. You need to understand something. The Sabbath is good for you personally. It’s God’s gift to you, personally. 

Mark 2:23-28. Jesus and his disciples were walking through the grain fields on the Sabbath. As they were talking and talking, they were brushing their hands over the heads of grain, rubbing off the chaff, and popping the grains in their mouth. It was permitted to do. It was called the law of gleaning. But it was the Sabbath. The Pharisees were outraged. “This is unlawful!" 

Jesus answered, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need? In the days 
of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to 
eat.” Then he said, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.” God is giving you a break for your benefit, 
not His. 

Well meaning people will say, "Id rather burn out that rust out.” In other words, overwork is good. Sitting around doing 
nothing is bad. Now, those of you know me know that I am completely speaking to myself in this chapter. I love to work. I 
enjoy being busy. Resting is not something I do well. Does anyone else understand that?! 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 3 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>How does taking a Sabbath rest help you, personally? 

&nbsp;

God wants us to take a break because it's good for us. Even Jesus took a rest. Jesus gets by Himself in a quiet place to rest. Rest and relaxation are not luxuries, they are necessities. 

Last week I got Covid. I didn’t have any of the normal symptoms: cough, fever, etc. I was just exhausted. Exhausted. I slept most of the day and worried that I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. But not a problem, I slept through the entire night. This went on for 7 days. I couldn’t concentrate to watch TV, I couldn't write. (Well, I did write a chapter for this study and threw it away after my head was out of the fog! Hahaha! You can thank me later for not having to suffer through it.)

WebMD (where I got my “doctorate”) says that when you relax, your heart rate slows, your breathing slows, your blood pressure goes down, your muscles relax… all things in your immune system work better- all from rest! And you know what else? You are more creative when you rest. Next time you have to make a quick decision, try sleeping on it. Walk away and spend a night thinking about it and asking God for a solution. 

Psalms 23 says, “The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not want. He _____ me lie down.” I can testify to that! And why would a shepherd do that? To restore your world. God has to make some of us lie down because we don’t do it on our own. So He is going to force you to lie down. 

The Sabbath is also good for your relationships. Look at Deuteronomy 5:14: “On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your ox, your donkey or any of your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns, so that your male and female servants may rest, as you do.”

This was for all the people and animals, and visitors. It wasn’t just for religious people, or those that felt like it. It wasn’t long ago that in our country, everything stopped on Sundays. In Israel, everything is closed on Saturday. Even the elevators in hotels get a Sabbath rest (remember that when we take your trip and if you are on the 10th floor and get on the elevator it will automatically stop at each floor going down because on the Sabbath the orthodox Jew was not permitted to press the buttons. So the entire nation takes time off, people can relate to each other in a different way. They can't work, so they might as well enjoy each other! 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 3 &#8729; Study Question 3** </span><br/><br/>Parents, when was the last time your children had a day off? An honest Sabbath rest? Think about it. We are so scheduled. Our schedules often revolve around the busy lives of our children. They have school, after school sports, lessons, and the list goes on and on. 

&nbsp;

The Sabbath is also good for you spiritually. This is a Sabbath of the LORD your God. When you take a Sabbath, you are acknowledging God. You are saying, "Lord, you are my provider. I have what I have - not because of what I have done, but because of what YOU have done for me. You gave me the talent, the skills, the resources. You brought me out of slavery.” The Sabbath is not a day to catch up on Netflix or run errands. 

Now, here's the question of the hour. When did the Sabbath change from Saturday to Sunday? Never. It didn’t. The Sabbath is still the seventh day of the week. Before you get bent out of shape saying that Sunday is originally a pagan holiday, so is every day of the week. Each day of the week has a history in paganism. 

I have grappled with this question for years. I do not believe that having a Sabbath on Sunday is anti-Jewish, a conspiracy or because of rebellion. There is no place in Scripture where the command of the Sabbath was rescinded. It is not scriptural to have a 7-day work week and ignore the Sabbath. I am not advocating for picking and choosing which laws we can follow, that couldn’t be further from the truth. 

First, we don’t actually know when the original Saturday is. Calendars have changed over the years. The Sabbath was changed from Saturday to Sunday by Constantine in 321 AD, in the 4th Century ([Synod Of Laodicea](https://orthodoxchurchfathers.com/fathers/npnf214/npnf2160.htm#P3294_592503)). But Christians were meeting on Sunday long before this. In fact, they were meeting on Sunday in the New Testament. They weren’t doing it as a conspiracy. Jesus rose from the dead on the first day of the week. And the resurrection, for us, is everything. Peter said we have a living hope because of the resurrection of Jesus from the dead. 

We don’t meet on Sunday because of Constantine (321 AD) or Ignatius (110AD), or the [Didache](https://legacyicons.com/content/didache.pdf) (80AD). We do it because the New Testament Christians did it. Acts 20:7 says, `“On the first day of the week we came together to break bread.”` The disciples had come together to break bread on the first day of the week.

1 Corinthians 16:2 says, `“On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made.”` Why the first day (Sunday)? Because that’s when they got together. It was because of the resurrection. 

The seventh day, Saturday, celebrates a finished creation. The first day, Sunday, celebrates a finished redemption. 

Romans 14:5 says, `“One person considers one day more sacred than another; another considers every day alike. Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind.”`

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 23:14-19

&nbsp;

There are three ordained pilgrimage festivals for Israel. Leviticus will talk about them in more detail. Although there would eventually be seven feasts (Don’t you love a God who likes a good party?), there were three special festivals where the Israelites were to journey to a specific place to celebrate. In the Wilderness, they were told to come before the LORD. In Canaan, they were told to journey to Jerusalem. 

These feasts have an enormous spiritual element to them, but for the purpose of this section, these instructions were intended to set Israel apart from other nations. The Feast of Unleavened Bread

All of the festivals were agriculturally based and since spring is considered the beginning of the yearly cycle, the first festival was a spring festival. 
The Feast of Unleavened Bread took place right after Passover. Passover was the 14th day of the first month on the Jewish calendar. The following day (15th - 21st was the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Unleavened bread is bread without yeast. It commemorated when the children of Israel left Egypt in a hurry and the bread did not have time to rise. 

Sin is often pictured as leaven in Scripture (Matthew 16:6, 11; Mark 8:15; Luke 12:1; Galatians 5:9). The Hebrew word translated as _Leavened Bread_ (חָמֵץ)<sup>[H2557](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2557/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H2557")</sup> is the word _Chametz_ (חָמֵץ)<sup>[H2557](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2557/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H2557")</sup>. It doesn't mean "leaven" in the same sense that we use it today (yeast). Chametz is any grain product in which fermentation has occurred. It is related to the word chamutz, which means "sour." Leaven (yeast) is used to produce fermentation, especially in bread dough. As the leaven sours the dough, tiny gas bubbles are produced with causes the dough too rise.

&nbsp;

Interestingly, this leavening process is also the first stage in decay. King David prophecies over the Messiah in Psalm 16:10 when he said, `“For you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, nor will you let your faithful one see decay.”` Jesus was a pure, sinless sacrifice. 

The Feast of First-fruits / Festival of Harvest / _Shavu‘ot_ (שָׁבוּעַ)<sup>[H7620](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7620/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H7620")</sup>

This feast occurs on the second day of the 7-day Feast of Unleavened Bread. Passover, The Feast of Unleavened Bread and the Feast of First-fruits happen one after another. (All three of these feasts have been fulfilled in Jesus’ coming as the Messiah. His death was depicted in Passover; that His body would not decay in the grave is seen in Unleavened Bread; and His resurrection is illustrated in First-fruits.) This was a feast of thanksgiving for the barley harvest, the first grain of the season. The first harvest is viewed as a promise of the larger harvest to come. It is also significant that Jesus rose from the dead on this holiday. Just as the barley harvest twas the promise of more to come, He is our first fruit, the promise of resurrection and eternal life for those who trust Him (1 Corinthians 15:20).

Feast of Ingathering / Festival of Booths / _Sukkot_ (סֻכָּה)<sup>[H5521](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5521/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H5521")</sup>

This feast is also called Sukkot, and the Feast of Booths. The Jews would present a harvest offering at the Temple during this feast. It is when they remember God’s sustaining power toward the Israelites in the desert. This feast was at the end of the year when you have gathered the fruit of your labor from the field. This happens in the seventh month from the 15th-22nd day. It is also called the _Feast of Booths_ or _Feast of Tabernacles_. 

The Feast of Tabernacles is about protection. While they were in the wilderness, they lived outside in tents and booths. Every year they set up little tents/or booths. They leave their homes, their air-conditioning, and their beds and live in these booths. They still do it today! Even though it says that the males were required to come, they made it a family gathering with their wives and children gathering in worship.

All of the fall feasts can be associated with Jesus’ second coming. The _Feast of Ingathering_ / _Sukkot_ (סֻכָּה)<sup>[H5521](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5521/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H5521")</sup> speaks for he day when the Messiah Himself with tabernacle among men, and wipe away every tear. Don’t you love that our God loves a good party?! 

Let’s turn our attention to the last portion of chapter 23 for a moment. I want to address the question of why a loving God would tell his people to kill the population of the land they are going to inhabit. It seems unfair.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span>Exodus 23:20-33 

&nbsp;

The first thing we notice is God is going to send an angel ahead of them to guard them along the way. _Yhwh_ instructs them to “listen to what he says. Don't rebel against him. He will not forgive your rebellion since my name is in him.” God is saying, he is a representative of _Yhwh_, so if they rebel against the angel, they are rebelling against God. 

Like God deals with us, He is not telling them everything they need to know. He is going too guide them step by step. Don’t you wish we could know everything? Well, maybe not. If we did, we might lose our courage! God is going to be with them, just as He is with us. He is not sending them out alone. What He is giving them is protection, guidance, ongoing instruction and leadership in battle. 

_Yhwh_ names the nations they will conquer. Why? Because these nations are not going to have a welcoming committee for all of these people. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>When we picture conquests, we picture bloody battle fields. But as you reread this portion of scripture, it’s hard to see the bloodshed. What do you see instead? 

There are some things that God says He will do, and some things that they are supposed to do. 

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 3** </span><br/><br/>What is _Yhwh__ going to do?

&nbsp;

Then look at verse 27. `“I will send my terror ahead of you and throw into confusion every nation you encounter. I will make all your enemies turn their backs and run.”` Plan A is to make them so afraid of Israel and _Yhwh_ that they just leave. God is going to drive them out little by little. He is going to make them evacuate. So what is Israel supposed to do? They will overthrow them and demolish their idols. Why? Because God does not want them to be enticed by other gods. They are to utterly demolish these idols…not the people. There is going to be a cleansing in the land. God does not even want them making covenants with the people. (If they are all killed, how could a covenant be made?)

So why can't the Canaanites stay? Because they worship other gods that will be a snare to the Israelites. That is the main problem- they would drag God’s people astray. This is not about cultural differences. It’s spiritual. And the interesting thing is they are not sending in the missionaries first. I mean, if we were writing the story, that’s what I’d expect. Send in the evangelists, tell them about God’s redemption power and then we all sing KumBaYah! 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 4** </span><br/><br/>Let’s look ahead just a bit and see if we can see the bloodshed in Deuteronomy 7:1-2. Aha! Here it is! In verse 2, God tells them to “utterly destroy them”. But again, he tells them not to make covenants. Can you make a covenant with a dead man? What does the word _Destroy_ (חָרַם)<sup>[H2763](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2763/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H2763")</sup> mean in verse 2? 

&nbsp;

The word is _Haram_ (חָרַם)<sup>[H2763](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2763/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H2763")</sup>. It means to prohibit or ban. They are supposed to haram them. It is setting them aside as not available. Do not intermarry with them. Do not make treaties. Do not worship their gods. It’s an issue of worship. They cannot serve two masters. Their allegiance needs to be with Yahweh and _Yhwh_ alone. 

Now I am not saying that there were not battles in the Bible. There were plenty. But I do think that in this case, God is going to fight this battle differently for them. 

Last week Target stores offered a shirt geared toward children that read, “Satan respects pronouns.” And they placed it in the front of their stores in the “pride” section. Christians started protesting shopping at Target, and rightly so. It’s a matter of worship.

# Day 5 &middot; _Confirmed Covenant_

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 24

God is getting the people ready to inhabit the land of Canaan. But first, they must agree to the covenant. In verse three they 
responded in one voice, `“Everything the LORD has said we will do.”` Then Moses wrote down everything the LORD had 
said. They are willing participants in the covenant with _Yhwh_.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>hy do you think the people of Israel agree to the covenant of _Yhwh_ with one voice? 

&nbsp;

The land of Canaan was first and foremost, a gift. The Israelites did not deserve it or earn it. It was a gift of grace. Anyone who says, “Israel is occupying the land in the Middle East and they are not entitled to that land” would be correct. They are entitled, they were gifted. Isn’t that like salvation? We aren’t entitled to it. It is a free gift. Occupying Canaan is going to be a process for them. They are going to have to work for this. If spiritual maturity was instantaneous, wouldn't that be great? If we could be perfected in a day…sign me up! But it’s not like that at all. We work out our salvation little by little. 

&nbsp;

```
Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. - (NIV Philippians 3:12-14)

&nbsp;

One other thing about Canaan is that it was never totally possessed by the Israelites. God promised the children of Israel a land mass of 300,000 square miles. That’s huge! At the height under King David and King Solomon, they only occupied 30,000 square miles. God promised them 300,000. The only took a tenth of everything God promised. (They won’t occupy the entire land until the millennium.) 

Like the Israelites, we often settle for less than what God has promised us. There are still Christians today that are somewhere between Egypt and Canaan- wandering in a wilderness and not enjoying any of the gifts God has given them. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Study Question 3** </span><br/><br/>What can we learn from the fact that the Israelites only occupied a small portion of the land God promised them? Why do we settle for less than what God has promised us?

&nbsp;

The beauty in our walk with the LORD is that we can grow as much as we want to grow. There is no limit. God will take us ankle deep, or swimming in water that we cannot reach the bottom. The question is, "How far do you want to go?” We can’t be “more” saved, but we can add to our faith, knowledge, self-control, patience… In verse 1, God calls to Moses and tells him, Aaron, Nadab and Abihu (Aaron’s sons), and the 70 elders of Israel to worship. When God calls you to worship, you should go! It is our highest privilege and greatest responsibility.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Study Question 4** </span><br/><br/>Why is worship considered a high privilege and responsibility?

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i>&nbsp; **Note** &nbsp;|</span>&nbsp; Nadab and Abihu are going to be struck dead for being “innovative” in the temple with their worship. I wonder if this mention of them is a foreshadowing. They got to go up to the presence of God and they’re going to take it very lightly. Hmmm… let’s reflect on that a moment. 

&nbsp;

But who does God call up all the way? Moses, the mediator. He’s going to act as both prophet and priest in this instance. 

Jesus is our mediator between God and man. It’s not the pope, or the priest, or the pastor, or the rabbi. It’s Jesus Christ. You do not need any person to go through to get to God- you can come boldly into His throne room yourself. Under the law, people had to worship from afar. Jesus changed all that. 

There are a few weird things in this chapter.

1. In verse four it mentions twelve pillar stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel. Can anyone remember how many tribes there were right now? There are actually 13 tribes right now because _Manasseh_ and _Ephraim_ are in place of Joseph. But the Bible refers only to twelve. The Levites have not yet been given the priestly tribe role yet. 

2. In verses 6-8 the covenant continues with blood. Moses takes blood and splashes it against the altar, then he sprinkles it on the people. I’m king of glad I wasn’t there for that one. 

In Middle Eastern covenants, animals were killed and cut into pieces. The pieces of the sacrificed animal were arranged around the altar. Then the two covenant parties would walk together between the pieces. Basically this meant that they were agreeing that if they broke the covenant, what happened to the animal would happen to them. Why would the people be sprinkled with blood? To signify that the blood of the covenant included or covered them as well. 

Aaron and his sons will eventually have blood sprinkled on them when they are commissioned as priests, but other than that, this is the only other time when someone is sprinkled with blood. In Leviticus 8 blood gets put on the alter and on the priest (his right earlobe, his right thumb and his right toe). So the blood seems to be their official invitation to the covenant. Think of it as a mini ordination ceremony to be a kingdom of priests. The only other case of someone being  sprinkled with blood is in Leviticus 14, but the blood is not applied to the altar, so it’s a little different. 

3. Then they see God and they eat and drink. They seal the deal with a meal! We will one day dine with Christ at the Marriage Feast of the Lamb! Can you just imagine what that will be like? 

What the children of Israel saw was a consuming fire on top of the mountain. And Moses goes up in the midst of the cloud to be on the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights. What is he doing on the mountain for that long? Moses already has the law. Now God is going to call him up for a set of blueprints for the tabernacle- a place of worship while they are in the desert. The number 40 is also the number of testing. Who was being tested for the 40 days and 40 nights? Not Moses. It was the children of Israel. 

What is happening in verses 14-18? What can you imagine the watching Israelites must have felt at this time? How did they understand God to be?

The last we see the Children of Israel, they have made a commitment to _Yhwh_ and the covenant. It’s a covenant of blood. They have seen God’s power on display on the mountain- and now they wait. With every law they were given, they also had the choice to obey or not. Will they? Will we? 

What will be said of you on the last day? You chose wisely? Or you chose poorly?
