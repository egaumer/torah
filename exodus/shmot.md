# _Sh'mot_ &sdot; שמות 
Parashah 13 &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; _Names (_ 1:1&mdash;6:1 _)_

The word _Sh'mot_ (שְׁמוֹת) means _Names_<sup>[H8034](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8034 "Strong's Number H8834")</sup>. This portion is named because the book begins with the phrase `“These are the names (Sh'mot) of the sons of Israel…”` The English name _Exodus_ comes from the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible. It means _Departure._ The book opens with the children of Israel in slavery. It seems God has forgotten them - but He has not.

# Day 1 &middot; _The Jewish Problem_

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 1

&nbsp;

Up until this point, most of the Israelites had become wealthy, numerous, and politically powerful in Egypt. But that was going to change. There was a new sheriff in town. His first job was to dismantle any foreign influence that could threaten Egypt. The Hebrews were going to have a radical reversal of fortunes. 

Contrary to popular belief, the Hebrews were not slave laborers in building the pyramids. The pyramids were already in place when Jacob arrived in Egypt. They are used to make mud bricks to create waterways and canals and build cities. 

Egypt at this time was magnificent. They had irrigation systems in the [Nile](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/nile-river/), making it the breadbasket of the world- although their rainfall was almost non-existent. They had wealth, beautiful land, and art. It was a beautiful place.

When the Hebrews longed for their life in Egypt, they didn’t miss the forced labor, they missed the certainty of food, shelter, and being a part of a familiar culture. 

From the close of Genesis to the beginning of the book of Exodus, _350 Years_ have passed. I am sure that the Hebrews felt that _God_ had abandoned them.

```
“These are the names of the sons of ___ who went to Egypt with ___ each with his family.” (Exodus 1:1 ESV)
```

The book of Exodus mentions both of his names in the first verse. The Jewish people are _The Sons of Israel_. _Verse 2_ is a list of names. Read them. Go on, read them all. Why read names? We don’t really care about names… unless, of course, it was YOUR name on that list! Jesus said the good shepherd calls his sheep by name and leads them out. So these names are very important. These are groups of very distressed people who are being called out by _God_ from Egypt to the Promised Land. 

Way back in Genesis 12:2, _God_ says to Abraham, `“I will bless you and make you a great nation.”` A few chapters later in Genesis 15:5, _God_ calls Abraham and says, `“Come outside. Look at those stars. Your descendants will be as numerous as the stars and sands of the earth. I’m going to make you a mega nation!”` And that’s exactly what God did. Because _God_ keeps His promises. 

Do you remember how many people came to Egypt with Jacob? (Gen 46:27) By the time we get to chapter 12 in Exodus, there will be over 600,000 men (ages 20-50, not including women and children.) [Estimates are between 2-3 million people](https://answersingenesis.org/bible-questions/did-600000-men-leave-egypt-moses/). That’s some big numbers!

In _Verse 6_ it tells us that Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died. We can think of this generation as the Egyptian immigrant generation, the refugees. Their experience in Egypt was very different from the second and third generations of Israelites. Joseph’s generation survived the great famine and thought of their stay in Egypt as temporary. The next generation did not think of going back to _Canaan_ at all. Egypt was the only place they knew, and it was a comfortable life. They were wealthy, numerous, and had political power. Why go back to _Canaan_? _Verse 7_ is the end of this golden era.

#### <i class="fa-solid fa-crown"></i> &nbsp; _A New Ruler_

How quickly we forget our own history. In our very own country, we are experiencing this in tremendous ways. We have a generation of Americans who really don’t know our history as one nation under _God_. How do you see this happening in the year you are living today? 

&nbsp;

In our very own country, we are experiencing this in tremendous ways. We have a generation of Americans who really don’t know our history as one nation under _God_. In what ways do we see a lack of historical awareness and forgetting of our own history in society today? What impact does it have?

&nbsp;

_Verse 8_: `“Then a ____ king, to whom Joseph meant ____, came to power in Egypt”`.

This king forgot his own history. He had no intention of honoring the deals that the previous pharaohs had with the Israelites. Mostly because this new king was Egyptian, the first Egyptian ruler of Egypt in a very long time.

Why did he change his mind about the Israelites (_Verses 9-10_)?

Do you think _God_ was saying, “Oh no! What do I do now?” _God_ is sovereign and He is in control. Sometimes it doesn’t seem that way. Have you been in a moment when you thought that this is the time the _God_ lost control? Did you need to be reminded that He is sovereign? Do you now? What is it that happened when you thought that maybe this was the time _God_ lost control of your life?

_God_ and Satan have an ongoing battle. What _God_ calls “good”, satan calls “bad.” _God_ counted the fruitfulness of Israel as a blessing. Pharaoh counted it as a curse. There is still a battle between good and evil today. 

The Pharaoh hated the Israelites, but also needed them, as they were key to the Egyptian economy. What was the solution? Control them. Keep their population under control and don’t let them leave. Pharaoh had to fix his fear of the Israelites outnumbering them. So he comes up with a solution: 

1. Break the backs of the adults so they don’t have any stamina (they also won’t be able to revolt).

This _God_ pattern is something we see today as well. The more that _God’s_ people are persecuted, the more fruitful they become! Israel never grew faster, the church never grew faster, then the under the worst persecution. If Israel had given up and decided to fully assimilate into Egyptian culture, they may have avoided persecution…but they would have also opted out of being so fruitful. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>Why do you think persecution often leads to greater fruitfulness for _God’s_ people? How does it challenge our notions of success and comfort?

&nbsp;

Why does this happen? Because persecution against Christians will separate the chaff from the wheat. Whenever there is persecution, when you have to pay a price for believing in _Christ_, fewer people will believe. There’s no bandwagon effect anymore. As long as the church takes the easy road, the more the world will avoid persecution…but we will also be less effective and less fruitful. It’s just the way _God’s_ economy works. 

2. Kill the newborns by having the midwives murder them.

What was the Pharaoh’s plan for the Hebrew midwives (_Verse 15_)? But why kill only the boys? Because boys could grow up and become an army. Pharaoh feared a possible Hebrew army, so kill the boys. The interesting thing is that when all is said and done, it’s the girls who will undermine him at every turn!

When you think of it, this plan was ridiculous. If he actually succeeded in this [infanticide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infanticide), he would only be reducing his workforce. But sometimes the devil doesn’t think that far in advance. 

What were the two midwives’ names?

What was Pharaoh’s name in Exodus?

The Bible only refers to him as Pharaoh. Yet, these two insignificant women are mentioned by name. How beautiful is that? 

Being a [midwife](https://www.midwiferysupplies.ca/blogs/ancient-midwifery-blog/295322-ancient-egyptian-midwifery-and-childbirth) was one of the few professions open to women. It was respected and valued. They assisted in labor, cut the umbilical cord, washed and rubbed the newborn in salt, and in the case of twins, they testified to which one was born first (for the all-important [firstborn blessing](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Firstborn_(Judaism))). They did not have children of their own because their full-time position was to help the birthing to others who were having babies. 

_Shiphrah_ and _Puah_ were probably the supervisory midwives, which is why Pharaoh specifically summons them. These women were most likely not Hebrews because Pharaoh couldn’t have expected a Hebrew to kill their fellow Hebrew children. Second, in _Verse 19_, they knew something about Egyptian birthing processes. Egyptian mothers would not employ a Hebrew midwife.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Study Question 3** </span><br/><br/>The Bible has these two women as heroines. In what other incidences in the Bible do we see women being used by _God_ to play significant roles? How does their inclusion challenge societal norms & expectations? 

&nbsp;

Pharaoh wanted the newborn sons to die. And _God_ never forgot this. He didn’t let it go. In fact, the ultimate and final plague upon the Egyptians is the death of their firstborn. Pharaoh tried to kill all the male children to eradicate the race, and it will be the final plague upon Egypt.

But the midwives feared _God_ more than they feared man. The government gave them a command- a death sentence for children. These women, however, believed in something called the sanctity of human life. Even though it was acceptable and allowed- even commanded- by the government, they didn’t do it. They didn’t riot or picket the palace. They just obeyed _God_. This is the first instance of civil disobedience in the Bible. They disobeyed the government. The government gave them a law, but they didn’t do it. _God’s_ law supersedes human law, every time. 

In Acts 4 and 5, a law was passed that the Gospel could not be preached publicly. It was illegal. So what did Peter and John do? They shared the Gospel with everyone. Why? Because Jesus had given them the law in Mark 16:15: `“He said to them, ‘Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation’”`.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Study Question 4** </span><br/><br/>What happened to these midwives in Exodus 1: 19-20? What does the reward of children for the midwives’ obedience teach us about _God’s_ faithfulness and blessings in the face of adversity?

&nbsp;

God provided them with children of their own! They would get to see their own babies born! _God_ is telling them, “I know you. I love you. And I am going to bless you for your obedience.” 

The chapter ends with Pharaoh’s 3rd Step: Since the midwives are not able to take care of this Jewish problem, then he will enlist all of the people to kill every Hebrew boy in the Nile. Let’s see how this ends up for Pharaoh…


&nbsp;
# Day 2 &middot; _Walk like an Egyptian_ 

How many people were saved by an ark? This is kind of a trick question. There’s Noah, his wife, three sons, and their wives…that’s 8. But that’s not the correct answer. The correct answer is _9_. Moses was also saved by an ark! 

Watch The Prince of Egypt Opening Song. If you are paying attention, (and you have watched my sermon on the [Belt of Truth - Ephesians 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPNaEdv9Vvg&t=1s)), you can see that their loins are girded, meaning they are working hard.

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 2.

&nbsp;

Before Moses will become The Deliverer, he will need to be delivered himself. And once again, it will be women who are undermining Pharaoh’s plans…this time in his own home!

The story of the Exodus is important to anyone who has ever suffered under oppression. _God_ commanded the Israelites to retell this story to their children in every generation.

The Israelites are in a horrible circumstance. The new king, an Egyptian, did not honor Joesph’s memory or promises made to him. The Israelites had been oppressed as slave laborers because of this. Without any sign of the Israelites ever attempting to take over, the new king determined these foreigners to be a threat and wanted to cause them shame and humiliation. This is how stereotypes work. We fear that someone will take over and we become scared, then we start assaulting them. If Pharaoh had succeeded, he would have wiped out the Hebrew people. Remember, the Egyptians are from Noah’s son, Ham (who was cursed), while the Israelites are from the line of Shem. 

In order to cut back numbers, it had to be the men they got rid of. But babies? Did they assault baby boys? It’s unimaginable. Sometimes Scripture loses its awe and terror to us, but imagine being a Hebrew and knowing that your infant, or soon-to-be-born infant, will be drowned in the Nile. It’s horrible. 

Moses was born into a life of trauma. Could you put your name in place of Moses’ in that sentence? 

What tribe was Moses born to? (_Verse 1_)

Moses’ mother hid him for three months. How difficult do you think that would be? Babies are notorious for &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;. (Well, I suppose you could put a lot of words in that blank! But they cry.) And to keep a baby quiet while you are living in a tent, surrounded by other people, is a step of faith! Hebrews 11:23 says they hid him by faith. This was not easy, as all the Egyptians were now Pharaoh’s official spies, watching for babies to be drowned. These parents were not afraid of the government, they feared the Lord. I suppose that’s a lesson all of its own! 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 2 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>If you had to write the concluding statement in a sermon about Hebrews 11:23 and Exodus 2:2, what would it be?

&nbsp;

_Verse 2_ - `Jochabed had a son and she saw that he was a ____ child`, and she hid him for three months. Different versions have different words. 

Using the www.blueletterbible.org, and toggling to different versions of the Bible (right next to the search bar-it doesn’t matter which version you choose, just explore a few), what other words do you see that describe how Moses’ mother saw him? ____ NIV- fine; KJV- goodly, CSB- beautiful…

Don’t all mothers look at their children and think they are the most beautiful things? Of course! 

Whatever word you found, go back to blueletterbible.org and find out what that word actually is and means. (_Tobe_ (טוֹב)<sup>[H2896](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2896/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H2896")</sup>)

Looking to the past, this is an association between Moses and the Genesis account of creation. After creating everything, _God_ said it was “good”, tov.  Moses’ birth is under divine influence. 

_Verse 3_ - `She hides him in a papyrus ____, coats it with ____ and ____, and sets him in the reeds of the Nile.` 

I’m sure when I was a teenager there were times when my parents wanted to put me in a boat and ship me down the river, but a baby? A 3-month-old baby? And to put your baby in the same waters where the Egyptians were drowning other Hebrew babies must have been heart-wrenching. Do you think she saw the other babies while she was saving her son? 

I suppose Jochabed was officially obeying the letter of the law when she put her son in the waters of the Nile, but she was also most certainly defying Pharaoh’s orders in the way she did it. She was trusting in the providence of _God_, and _God_ did not fail her. 

There are only two places in Scripture that mention the word _Tevah_ (תֵּבָה)<sup>[H8392](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8392/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H8392")</sup>. One is the vessel that Noah built, and the other is the basket vessel in which Moses was placed. Both arks: In Genesis, mankind would be eliminated by a flood of water- but _God_ saved Noah and his family safely in the _Tevah_ to ride atop the water. In Exodus, all Israelite male babies would be eliminated by being drowned in the Nile, but _God_ make sure that the deliverer of Israel was saved in a tevah to ride atop the water. 

This is not an allegory. It is a pattern. _God_ used water and an ark as the early elements of the types of salvation. The first was to save mankind. The second was to save the Hebrews. 

Here’s the beautiful thing, and I hope this blesses you. I love that _God_ would build an ark for just one - just one! This is why the angels rejoice when just one comes to know the Lord. It is the beauty of the salvation of one! 

When Pharaoh’s daughter came to the Nile to perform her religious practices, she saw the basket, heard the baby cry, and all her maternal instincts told her to rescue the child and care for him. God used a baby’s tears to control the heart of a powerful princess. And then He used Miriam’s words to arrange for the baby’s mother to raise the boy- and get paid for it! Pharaoh paid for the deliverer to be raised in a godly home. _God_ works in amazing ways! 

Miriam asks Pharaoh’s daughter in _Verse 7_, `“Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you”`? Little does she know, but she is mirroring Moses’ exact words to Pharaoh when he says, “Let my people go.” Only this time Pharaoh’s daughter says in _Verse 8_, “Yes, go.” 

The Bible doesn’t give us Moses’ exact age when Jochabed had to give him up, but in general, an infant was nursed until five years of age. In tribal societies today, the average age of weaning is closer to 6-7 years old. If that was the case, Moses would have known his family well, had a good grasp of the Hebrew language, and been firmly rooted in his faith. (Train up a child in the way they should go, and when they are old they will not depart from it. Proverbs 22:6).

When _God_ wants to accomplish a mighty work, He often starts by sending a baby. It was true for Isaac, Joseph, Samuel, John the Baptist, and especially Jesus. _God_ can (and does) use the weak thing to defeat the mightiest enemies (1 Cor. 1:25-29). A baby’s tears were _God’s_ first weapon in His war against Egypt.

Why do you think _God_ often starts His might work by sending a baby?

A word to the moms out there. Jochabed had faith to hide him, but it wasn’t over. Because when Moses grew up, became the son of another woman. And not just any other woman, a foreign woman, an idolater, an Egyptian who believed in a bunch of gods that didn’t exist. It’s not how she raised him. But Moses belonged to _God_ more than he belonged to Jochabed.

&nbsp;

God’s ways are not ours. Egypt would seem like the least likely place for _God_ to start training a leader. But _God_ did it in several ways: 

- Moses was highly educated (Acts 7:22). Egypt was the leader in the areas of engineering, mathematics, and astronomy. We, also, should learn all we can, and dedicate it to the Lord as we serve Him. 

- Moses failed. He was confused about his racial identity (he was a Hebrew, but raised by Egyptians). He killed an Egyptian- probably also saving a Hebrew’s life. Then he fled for his life. Moses was sent to the Midian desert for 40 years. He needed to learn that deliverance would come from _God’s_ hand, not Moses’ hand. Moses’ first 40 years he tried to be something. In the next 40 years, God is going to show him that he is nothing. In the following 40, _God_ is going to show him that _God_ can take nothing and make something with him.

&nbsp;

_God’s_ delays aren’t evidence of His unconcern. He hears our cries, feels our sorrows, and remembers His covenant. But Moses was being prepared to be used by _God_. 

How can you find comfort and hope in knowing that _God_ hears your cries, feels your sorrows, and remembers His covenant?

# Day 3 &middot; _What’s in a name?_

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 3. 

&nbsp;

Moses is now a shepherd. He did not own his own flock, as he was tending his father-in-law’s flock. Most likely, Moses learned the art of shepherding from his wife and her sisters. Growing up in Pharaoh’s house, shepherds were reviled. So Moses most likely didn’t have anything to do with them in Egypt. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 3 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>Think of the differences between who he was in Egypt and who he is now. What differences in his lifestyle can you think of? 

&nbsp;

Now, do you remember back in Genesis 46, when Joseph brings his family to the land of Goshen? Finish the sentence from _Verse 34_, `“all shepherds are ____ to the Egyptians”`.

He was pampered in Egypt, now he has the job that he had grown to despise. Yet, this is preparation for his future. He’s going to find it extremely valuable. Spending time on this mountain is going to be helpful because he will lead the children of Israel to that same topography.  He’s also leading sheep…which is not far from leading people! He is also learning humility. 

This was a day like all the previous days in the 40 years he’d been in this desert. Note: when _God_ moves in your life, you won’t get an advanced warning. Has that ever happened to you? Without warning, God starts something new. He doesn’t consult you or give you a dream. Just one day, an ordinary day turns into an extraordinary one. 

I’m pretty sure that Moses wasn’t prepared for what came next… a panel of the Lord was standing inside of a burning bush, calling out his name! If I were Moses, I would have run directly in the opposite direction as fast as I could. But Moses thinks, “Hmmm. That’s strange. I’m going to check it out!” 

In verse 5, _God_ instructs Moses to remove his sandals. Why? Why is the ground holy? Because _God_ was there. And where _God_ is, the place is holy.

The removal of one’s sandals was, and remains, a standard Middle Eastern sign of respect when entering the presence of a king or a god. But _God_ didn’t command Moses to take off his sandals because he was in _God’s_ presence- rather, the ground was holy. (We’ll find out later in the Torah that holiness was something that could be transmitted from person-to-person, person-to-object, or object to object.) Had Moses kept wearing his shoes, he would have transmitted holiness to everything his feet touched. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 3 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>_God_ introduces Himself to Moses in verse 6. How does He do that? What significance does His introduction hold?

&nbsp;

When _God_ introduces Himself to Moses, He says, `“I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob”`. In this one sentence, _Yhwh_ now only introduces Himself to Moses, but also gives Moses an identify. Up until now, Moses’ Hebrew father has not been in the picture. Who is Moses’ Egyptian father? We don’t know. Moses doesn’t know. Is he Egyptian? Is he Hebrew? God tells him right here. `“I am the God of your father”`. And you belong to Me. But Moses still has a lot to learn about who he is and who _God_ wants him to be. Can you relate? 

_God_ is bringing to Moses’ mind the covenant He made with Abraham in Genesis 15. Read _Verses 13-16_. It is over 400 years since _God_ had this conversation with Abraham, and He is about to keep His promise in delivering His people. The Israelites have talked about this covenant for 400 years. 

Have you ever received a promise from _God_ and then had to wait what seems like an eternity for it to come to pass? Are you still in a waiting period? It’s hard, isn’t it? We can’t assume that our perception of a long period of _God’s_ silence in our lives means we’ve been forgotten. These periods are actually essential to our spiritual growth. It is our preparation time. _God’s_ purpose in our life will always include a period of divine silence. You should expect it. 

_God_ sees our misery. He hears our cries. He is concerned with our suffering. And He WILL bring you out.
 
I’m sure while _God_ was talking, Moses was “amen”-ing! _God_ says, “I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt.” Moses replies, _Amen_! 
_God_ says, “`I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers”`. And Moses adds, _Amen_. 

_God_ says he is going to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians. Moses is probably throwing his hands in the air and shouting, “Amen!” 

_God_ is going to lead them to a land flowing with milk and honey. “Amen and Amen!”

Then _Verse 10_ - `“So, now, ____. I am sending ____ to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.”` Pump the brakes! Say WHAT?!!! 

_God_ was on a roll there for a while. He was saying all the things Moses had been dreaming that _God_ would say. _God_ hears. He is going to rescue. The people will be going to a great place. All good stuff. Then _God_ throws in a whammy. But YOU, Moses, have a job to do. 

Who doesn’t want the blessings of _God_? We want _God_ to hear us. We want God to rescue us. We want to be in a better place. But the whole “service” thing is what stops us. Can’t we just go to church, pray at the altar, and magically walk away with healing, healthy relationships, or revival? We’re not prepared to have a job to do. We just want the Holy vending machine in the sky to pour out blessings. It’s a one-way street. Right? Wrong. 

_God_ is calling Moses to be His instrument of deliverance. This is a _God_ pattern. _God’s_ ways are almost the complete opposite of the way a human would expect.

* First, _God_ approaches the one He has chosen. _God_ initiates the contact. Sometimes it’s through a dream or a vision. With Moses, it’s a direct face-to-face confrontation. 

* Second, the chosen one is either reluctant or outright refuses the call at first. I’m sure we could name many, many prophets that fit this category. Which one comes to your mind first?

* Third, the prophet candidate (male or female) returns to society, or wherever _God_ sent them, without concern for the opposition they will receive, and ready to speak with authority to any power that comes against them. And often, the prophet will not receive even the tiniest amount of respect from their former friends and family.

&nbsp;

_God_ is looking for specific characteristics of the people He chooses. _God_ wants someone who doesn’t consider themselves worthy, someone who thinks it is impossible to carry out the task alone. And above all, they must understand that if _God_ doesn’t do it all, it simply can’t happen. Let’s get real. Are you actively serving in your local church?

_God_ understood the attributes of the man that He would use to bring His people out of Egypt. Moses did not think he was capable, but _God_ did. _God_ may be calling your name to help further His church. He is calling on YOU to be a missionary and share your testimony and bring people to Him.

_God_ reassured Moses that He would be with him. Moses questions Him and asks what he should say if the people want to know _God’s_ name. Obviously, Moses didn’t know the answer either. Moses grew up in Egypt and had enough of the world in his that he forgotten that his forefathers called _God_, _El_ (אֵל)<sup>[H410](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h410/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H410")</sup> _Shaddai_ (שַׁדַּי)<sup>[H7706](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7706/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H7706")</sup>. The Israelites had been living with pagan worship for the past four centuries. Let’s put this into perspective. As of the time of this writing, the United States of America has been around for 247 years. Look around and see how far we’ve come from our roots. They had been removed from their roots for 430 years. (I can’t even imagine what our country would look like. At our rate, I do believe that it would be completely unrecognizable as a Christian country.)

Moses understood that the name of a god told about the characteristics that were directly associated with that god. It told who that god had control or influence over. (If you were clever enough…and the Egyptians definitely thought they were…you could match up your particular needs with the god that had control to fulfill them. It was kind of like having a genie in a bottle.) 

Then, in _Verse 15_, _God_ told him His personal name: _Yhwh_. We pronounce it Yahweh, but we actually don’t really know the correct pronunciation. This is the first time that mankind ever received _God’s_ formal eternal name. 

_God_ gave Moses what he was looking for, His characteristics. `“I Am that I Am”`. His name is `“I AM”`, not “I was” or “I might be” or “I may get to it.” He is in control. Always has been, always will be. He is eternal. He is one of a kind. He is always present and always with us. No Egyptian god had such a name as this.

# Day 4 &middot; _What’s in your hand?_

Exodus 4 is just a continuation of Exodus 3. We are still in the same conversation between Moses and _God_ at the burning bush. 

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 4. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>In Exodus 4, Moses expresses doubts about his ability to fulfill God’s calling. Have you ever doubted yourself in a similar way? How did you overcome those doubts? Let’s make a list of strategies we can share! Moses is a little nervous. God is saying some really great things, but Moses is not buying that he’s “the man to do it.”

&nbsp;

_God_ told Moses in Exodus 3:18 that the people would listen to him. Moses disagreed. So, _God_, in His mercy, gives Moses signs that he will be able to do this task. 

What was the question _God_ asks Moses in _Verse 2_?

What was the first sign that _God_ gave to Moses (_Verses 2-5_)? 

Moses was holding a stick, a shepherd’s staff. A shepherd was reviled by the Egyptians; but _God_ is going to use this very symbol to lead Israel. 

When Moses throws his staff on the ground, it became a &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;. Moses ran from it! It is no coincidence that a serpent was used. It was the Egyptian symbol of power and authority. Pharaohs wore the symbol of a golden serpent on their heads. Moses knew this symbol. He was raised as a prince of Egypt. He also was very aware of the symbolism of a shepherd’s staff. 

It is interesting that satan is represented as a serpent, and Jesus is known as the Good Shepherd. A simple shepherd, Moses, is going to grab this serpent, Egypt, by its tail! I don’t know a lot about snakes, but when picking it up, I don’t think I would think to pick it up by its tail. That leaves the most dangerous part open to striking at you. Yet, this is how God instructed Moses to grab it. This sign was directed directly at Egypt. The powerful snake is going to be overcome by a lowly shepherd. 

What was the second sign (_Verses 6-7_)?

The second sign was directed toward Israel. Moses’ clean hand was inserted into his cloak, but when he pulled it out, it was diseased. Then this defiled and diseased hand was put back into the cloak and became clean. God’s chosen people began pure. God allowed them to become impure in Egypt. But _God_ can redeem. _God_ can take the most defiled person, (or nation) and purify them. 

What was the third sign (_Verse 9_)? 

The third sign was directed toward the worthless gods of Egypt. The Egyptians had many gods which came from the Nile, but the Nile itself was also a god. Moses is going to turn the Nile water into blood. _God_ is going to prove his complete mastery over the mysterious religious system of Egypt. 

The idea of multiple gods was commonly held. In Exodus 20 we will study the _Ten Commandments_. The first thing _God_ instructs is: `“you shall have no other gods before Me”`. The whole world had other gods, hundreds of them. The number of gods a nation possessed corresponded to their assumed wealth and power. So Israel, who worshipped only _Yhwh_, was considered by other nations to be god-poor because they only had one god. When we see the OT referring to _Yhwh_ as the `“God above all gods”` that’s exactly what it meant to the people of that day. To us, we see that statement as a declaration of grandeur, or we make it mean that _God_ Almighty is more important than anything else in our lives. While that it all true, that is not what it meant to the early Hebrews. To them, the idea of one god being better and higher than other gods was quite literal. We have to put ourselves in the mindset of those times. This is not allegory. _God_ Almighty being above all 
other gods is exactly what it meant.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>We can think of ourselves as superior in our thinking, but don’t do that. Israel was in the beginning stages of their walk with the Lord. When you first accepted _Christ_, where were you and how did your understanding of _God_ and the world change? 

&nbsp;

_God_ found you right where you were- in your mess. We didn’t get our lives all together and then accept _Christ_. Just as it has taken us time and a lot of hard lessons, it will take time and hard lessons for Israel to comprehend the basic concept that there is but one _God_. Not just one _God_ for Israel, but one _God_ period. One _God_ over everyone and everything. This was against their basic understanding of the way the world worked. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 3** </span><br/><br/>What was Mose’s last ditch effort to avoid accepting God’s calling on his life in verse 10? Can you relate to this kind of resistance to following a divine calling?

&nbsp;

Jewish tradition says that Moses most likely had forgotten how to speak Hebrew well. Others think that with 40 years in the desert, he didn’t know Egyptian well enough to approach the king. This is most likely a better interpretation because it’s hard to imagine that Moses spoke Hebrew to the Pharaoh. 

_God_ responded with anger! Moses had no idea who _God_ was about, what His purposes were, or how powerful He was. So _God_ began at the beginning. What questions did _God_ ask Moses (_Verse 11_)? 

What did _God_ promise Moses in _Verse 12_? 

After _God’s_ promise, what was Moses’ response (_Verse 13_)? 

Wrong answer. _God_ is going to have his older brother Aaron speak for him. So, _God_ spoke to Moses, Moses spoke to Aaron, and Aaron spoke to Pharaoh and to the people. God saw Moses as special. He was not just another Bible character, as we see him today. He was given the power to work miracles and speak as if he were _God_. What an incredible responsibility! No wonder he didn’t want the job. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 4** </span><br/><br/>Would you want the responsibility and authority that Moses had in speaking and performing miracles on behalf of _God_? What pros and cons do you see in such a role?

&nbsp;

Moses ultimately makes the right decision; he is going to obey _God_. Moses gets approval from his father-in-law, Jethro, to leave and confront Pharaoh. This is customary, as Jethro was the head of the house in which Moses lived. 

In verse 19, the _Lord_ tells Moses it is safe to go back to Egypt. Why? _God_ knew that Moses would be afraid of those people. _God_ knows our thoughts. He chose to comfort Moses in this situation. 

THINK ABOUT IT: Has _God_ ever comforted you? How?

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 5** </span><br/><br/>The _Lord_ speaks to Moses early on his trip to Egypt. He is going to tell Moses what is going to happen. Read the end of _Verse 21_. What do you think about what _God_ said regarding Pharaoh’s heart? 

&nbsp;

If you are having a hard time with _God_ hardening Pharaoh’s heart, step in line. Many people have been troubled by it. Is it fair? What chance did Pharaoh have to do the right thing? Did _God_ make Pharaoh incapable of obeying Him? Does _God_ do this now? 

We have to look to scripture to get our answers. In both Exodus 4:21 and Exodus 7:3-4 _God_ is speaking prophetically. This is something that will happen in the future. This was going to happen and _God_ thought Moses needed to be forewarned, or he would become discouraged. _God_ was going to use Pharaoh’s already rebellious heart for His purposes. This is a great moment to mention that _God_ can use anyone for His purpose. 

There are some people who need to learn the hard way. Do you know one? Are you one? Change sometimes only happens when our pain is so great, and when we are so low that we can only look up to _God_. Sometimes _God_ hardens hearts so they can more easily see Him. 

Our hearts can be hardened because, like Pharaoh, we are already rebellious. It’s not _God’s_ will that any should perish, but that doesn’t mean that a vast amount of humans will not perish. We know that the path to destruction is wide. When we resist listening to the LORD, our heart  hardens a little more…it’s a slow fade, but it’s a fade.

&nbsp;

Judges 16:20 is one of the saddest verses in the Bible. Samson was set apart to be used by _God_. But after a lifetime of living his own way, when he was the most ensnared by sin, the Bible says that `“he did know know that the LROD had left him”`. It was a slow fade away from the perfect will of _God_. 

_Lord_, keep us in your perfect will. Keep our hearts soft toward Your voice. Help us to listen and obey the first time. 

&nbsp;
# Day 5 &middot; _The name of the Lord_

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 5-6:1.

&nbsp;

Exodus 5:1 Moses and Aaron tell Pharaoh that the _God_ of Israel wants him to `"'Let My people ____' so they can hold a ____ in the wilderness"`. 

This is a direct approach, but also a soft approach. They don’t come walking in saying, “Hey, boss man, you better do what we say or you’re toast.” This is a softer ask, but it will change. Oh boy, will it change. Have you ever asked yourself, “Why, oh why, didn’t I learn the first time?” (Don’t answer that!) 

We are going to see another _God_-pattern here. _God_ first comes with revelation and with grace and mercy and an invitation before He comes with judgment. Way before _God_ sent the flood, Noah was called a `Preacher of Righteousness`` (2 Pet 2:5). Noah preached with grace and mercy and an invitation for people to come into the safety of the ark. But there came a time when that invitation was closed and the people saw a _God_ of judgement when the floods came. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>In what ways does _God’s_ pattern of revealing grace and mercy before judgment apply to our own lives and experiences? 

&nbsp;

Similarly, before the judgment of Egypt, Moses requested that Pharaoh allow the people to rest from their labor (_Verse 5_). Pharaoh, however, began to harden his heart and made life more difficult for the people. This behavior is similar to that of Satan, who makes life harder for those who seek to follow _God_. He sees _God’s_ people wanting to get serious about the things of _God_, to worship Him, to hold a festival to Him. You may be there now. You may be at the place where you are thinking, “This is it. I want to give _God_ 100%, not the leftovers of my life. I want to live a Godly life.” Do you really think Satan is standing up giving you a standing ovation for that? When a person decides to pursue _God_, Satan and his demons do not applaud the decision. They are not saying, “Well, it’s about time. He finally did it! Great choice!” 

Ha! Hardly the case. That’s the time the demons of hell dig in their heels and the attacks come. There are so many people who get to this point in their walk and give up. They just don’t get it. They changed their life. They turned things around and they have more trials than ever.

Satan WILL submit to _God’s_ power. There is no question. But it’s not going to be without a fight. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>How does satan’s opposition and resistance intensify when someone decides to pursue a godly life? Have you experiences this in your own spiritual journey?<br/><br/>Record how many times you read the word _Lord_ and _God_ in this chapter.

&nbsp;

Does that surprise you? 

Every ancient culture believed in multiple gods and a spirit world. Every culture had a similar set of gods, but their names varied. But knowing each god’s name was all-important to the ancient mind. Knowing a god’s name was the key to communicating with that god and persuading that god to do what was desired. 

Here, Pharaoh is not wondering if there is a “_God_ of the Hebrews”, he has just never heard of _Yhwh_. Since he has not ever heard of _Yhwh_, he wasn’t sure where this _God_ even fit into the hierarchy of all the Egyptian gods. So if Pharaoh had never even heard of this _God_, why should he be concerned about him? After all, this _God_ only revealed His name to mankind only a few weeks prior. And now this _God_ is demanding something of Pharaoh? And the demand is that the Hebrew slaves need to make a “pilgrimage festival to Me.” Really? Put yourself in Pharaoh’s shoes right now. Would youbelieve Moses?

Pharaoh is not buying it. These Hebrews did not belong to this “God”… they belong to Pharaoh! Pharaoh does not deny that there is a god called _Yhwh_, and he doesn’t deny that this was Israel’s _God_. He just doesn’t know what it has to do with him. There were many Egyptian gods, so why worry about one little god of a bunch of slaves? If this god was so powerful, how could His people be slaves in the first place? Nothing to worry about here. The Hebrews just have too much time on their hands.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 3** </span><br/><br/>Moses and Aaron tell Pharaoh that if they don’t obey that (_Verse 3_) `“God may ____"`.

&nbsp;

They may have embellished what _God_ actually told them a bit. I mean, they are standing in front of the most powerful man in the known world. 

You can hear the laughter in Pharaoh’s voice as he tells them to get back to work. He has no intention of letting 3 million of the finest craftsman in Egypt, who did the bulk of the building, go on a three-day holiday. If he allows this now, it will set a precedent that he did not want repeated. 

What does Pharaoh make them do in _Verse 7-9_?

&nbsp;

How did the Hebrew overseers react to Pharaoh not giving them straw (_Verses 15-21_)? Boy, they turned on Moses pretty quickly. They went from praising _God_ to calling on _God_ to judge Moses by punishing him. They knew in advance how this would go. Moses already told them. They did not count on any consequences. Following _God_ always has consequences.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Study Question 4** </span><br/><br/>Have you ever faced consequences or paid a price for following God? What was that experience like for you? 

&nbsp;

Moses completely understood why the Hebrews were upset. 

What did Moses do when he did not understand what was happening (_Verse 22_)?

Look back. What is the last question Moses said to the _Lord_ in Exodus 5:22-23?

_God_ answers Moses by letting him know that He has it all under control. He returned to the _Lord_. He didn’t stamp his feet. He didn’t shake his fist at _God_. And even if he did, who would blame him? But Moses was learning that there is a price to pay for obedience. Oh, that we could learn that lesson. Obedience and sacrifice go hand-in-hand. We will see this throughout all of scripture. What have you sacrificed because of your obedience to _God_?

Here’s the best part. Read Exodus 6:1. Moses asks for an explanation, and _God_ answers Moses: I’ve got it all under control. Maybe you need to hear that one statement today. _God’s_ got this.
