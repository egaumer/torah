# SH'MOT &sdot; שמות 
**Parashah 14 &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; Names** *(1:1–6:1)*

&nbsp;
# Day 1 &middot; _The Jewish Problem_

The word Sh'mot (Hebrew: שְׁמוֹת) means _“names”_. This portion is named because the book begins with the phrase _“These are the names (Sh'mot) of the sons of Israel…”_ The English name Exodus comes from the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible. It means _“departure.”_ The book opens with the children of Israel in slavery. It seems God has forgotten them - but He has not. 

Read [Exodus 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1&version=CJB).

Up until this point, most of the Israelites had become wealthy, numerous, and politically powerful in Egypt. But that was going to change. There was a new sheriff in town. His first job was to dismantle any foreign influence that could threaten Egypt. The Hebrews were going to have a radical reversal of fortunes. 

Contrary to popular belief, the Hebrews were not slave laborers in building the pyramids. The pyramids were already in place when Jacob arrived in Egypt. They are used to make mud bricks to create waterways and canals and build cities. 

Egypt at this time was magnificent. They had irrigation systems in the Nile, making it the breadbasket of the world- although their rainfall was almost non-existent. They had wealth, beautiful land, and art. It was a beautiful place.

When the Hebrews longed for their life in Egypt, they didn’t miss the forced labor, they missed the certainty of food, shelter, and being a part of a familiar culture. 

From the close of Genesis to the beginning of the book of Exodus, 350 years have passed. I am sure that the Hebrews felt that God had abandoned them.

?> Exodus 1:1</br>
“These are the names of the sons of _______________ who went to Egypt with ________________ each 
with his family.”

The book of Exodus mentions both of his names in the first verse. The Jewish people are “the sons of Israel.” 

[Exodus 1:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A2&version=CJB) is a list of names. Read them. Go on, read them all. Why read names? We don’t really care about names…unless, of course, it was YOUR name on that list! Jesus said the good shepherd calls his sheep by name and leads them out. So these names are very important. These are groups of very distressed people who are being called out by God from Egypt to the Promised Land. 

Way back in [Genesis 12:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+12%3A2&version=CJB), God says to Abraham, _“I will bless you and make you a great nation.”_ A few chapters later in [Genesis 15:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+15&version=CJB), God calls Abraham and says, _“Come outside. Look at those stars. Your descendants will be as numerous as the stars and sands of the earth. I’m going to make you a mega nation!”_ And that’s exactly what God did. Because God keeps His promises. 

Do you remember how many people came to Egypt with Jacob? ([Gen 46:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+46%3A27&version=CJB)) ___________________

By the time we get to [Exodus 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+12&version=CJB), there will be over 600,000 men (ages 20-50, not including women and children.) Estimates are between 2-3 million people. That’s some big numbers!

In [verse 6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A6&version=CJB) it tells us that Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died. We can think of this generation as the Egyptian immigrant generation, the refugees. Their experience in Egypt was very different from the second and third generations of Israelites. Joseph’s generation survived the great famine and thought of their stay in Egypt as temporary. The next generation did not think of going back to Canaan at all. Egypt was the only place they knew, and it was a comfortable life. They were wealthy, numerous, and had political power. Why go back to Canaan? 

[Verse 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A7&version=CJB) is the end of this golden era. 

#### A New Ruler

How quickly we forget our own history. In our very own country, we are experiencing this in tremendous ways. We have a generation of Americans who really don’t know our history as one nation under God. How do you see this happening in the year you are living today? 

---

[Verse 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A8&version=CJB): “Then a 
&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; king, to whom Joseph meant
&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;, came to power in Egypt.”

This king forgot his own history. He had no intention of honoring the deals that the previous pharaohs had with the Israelites. Mostly because this new king was Egyptian, the first Egyptian ruler of Egypt in a very long time.

Why did he change his mind about the Israelites ([vs 9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A9-10&version=CJB))?

---

Do you think God was saying, “Oh no! What do I do now?” God is sovereign and He is in control. Sometimes it doesn’t seem that way. 

Have you been in a moment when you thought that this is the time the God lost control? Did you need to be reminded that He is sovereign? Do you now? What is it that happened when you thought that maybe this was the time God lost control of your life?

---

God and Satan have an ongoing battle. What God calls “good”, satan calls “bad.” God counted the fruitfulness of Israel as a blessing. Pharaoh counted it as a curse. There is still a battle between good and evil today. 

The Pharaoh hated the Israelites, but also needed them, as they were key to the Egyptian economy. What was the solution? Control them. Keep their population under control and don’t let them leave. 

1. Break the backs of the adults so they don’t have any stamina (they also won’t be able to revolt).

This God pattern is something we see today as well. The more that God’s people are persecuted, the more fruitful they become! Israel never grew faster, the church never grew faster, then the under the worst persecution. If Israel had given up and decided to fully assimilate into Egyptian culture, they may have avoided persecution…but they would have also opted out of being so fruitful. 

Why does this happen? Because persecution against Christians will separate the chaff from the wheat. Whenever there is persecution, when you have to pay a price for believing in Christ, fewer people will believe. There’s no bandwagon effect anymore. As long as the church takes the easy road, the more the world will avoid persecution…but we will also be less effective and less fruitful. It’s just the way God’s economy works. 

2.  Kill the newborns.

What was the Pharaoh’s plan for the Hebrew midwives ([vs 15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A15&version=CJB))?

---

When you think of it, this plan was ridiculous. If he actually succeeded in this infanticide, he would only be reducing his workforce. But sometimes the devil doesn’t think that far in advance. 

What were the two midwives’ names?

---

What was Pharaoh’s name in Exodus?

---

The Bible only refers to him as Pharaoh. Yet, these two insignificant women are mentioned by name. How beautiful is that? 

Being a midwife was one of the few professions open to women. It was respected and valued. They assisted in labor, cut the umbilical cord, washed and rubbed the newborn in salt, and in the case of twins, they testified to which one was born first (for the all-important [firstborn blessing](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Firstborn_(Judaism))). They did not have children of their own because their full-time position was to help the birthing to others who were having babies. 

Shiphrah and Puah were probably the supervisory midwives, which is why Pharaoh specifically summons them. These women were most likely not Hebrews because Pharaoh couldn’t have expected a Hebrew to kill their fellow Hebrew children. Second, in [verse 19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A19&version=CJB), they knew something about Egyptian birthing processes. Egyptian mothers would not employ a Hebrew midwife.

The Bible has these two women as heroines. What other women in the Bible were used by God? 

---

Pharaoh wanted the newborn sons to die. And God never forgot this. He didn’t let it go. In fact, the ultimate and final plague upon the Egyptians is the death of their
&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;. Pharaoh tried to kill all the male children to eradicate the race, and it will be the final plague upon Egypt. 

But the midwives feared God more than they feared man. The government gave them a command- a death sentence for children. These women, however, believed in something called the sanctity of human life. Even though it was acceptable and allowed- even commanded- by the government, they didn’t do it. They didn’t riot or picket the palace. They just obeyed God. This is the first instance of civil disobedience in the Bible. They disobeyed the government. The government gave them a law, but they didn’t do it. God’s law supersedes human law, every time. 

In [Acts 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+4&version=CJB) and [5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+5&version=CJB), a law was passed that the Gospel could not be preached publicly. It was illegal. So what did Peter and John do? They shared the Gospel with everyone. Why? Because Jesus had given them the law in [Mark 16:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+16%3A15&version=CJB): 

---

What happened to these midwives? [Exodus 1:19-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A19-20&version=CJB):

---

God provided them with children of their own! They would get to see their own babies born! God is telling them, “I know you. I love you. And I am going to bless you for your obedience.”

# Day 2 &middot; _Walk like an Egyptian_ 

How many people were saved by an ark? This is kind of a trick question. There’s Noah, his wife, three sons, and their wives…that’s 8. But that’s not the correct answer. The correct answer is nine. Watch the opening scene of [“The Prince of Egypt”](https://bit.ly/princeofegyptopening). If you are paying attention, you can see that their loins are girded, meaning they are working hard. 

Read Exodus 2.

The story of the exodus is important to anyone who has ever suffered under oppression. God commanded the Israelites to retell this story to their children in every generation.

The Israelites are in a horrible circumstance. The new king, an Egyptian, did not honor Joesph’s memory or promises made to him. The Israelites had been oppressed as slave laborers because of this. Without any sign of the Israelites ever attempting to take over, the new king determined these foreigners to be a threat and wanted to cause them shame and humiliation. This is how stereotypes work. We fear that someone will take over and we become scared, then we start assaulting them. If Pharaoh had succeeded, he would have wiped out the Hebrew people.

Remember, the Egyptians are from Noah’s son, Ham, while the Israelites are from the line of Shem. 

In order to cut back numbers, it had to be the men they got rid of. But babies? Did they assault baby boys? It’s unimaginable. Sometimes Scripture loses its awe and terror to us, but imagine being a Hebrew and knowing that your infant, or soon-to-be-born infant, will be drowned in the Nile. It’s horrible. 
Moses was born into a life of trauma. Could you put your name in place of Moses’ in that sentence? 

What tribe was Moses born to? (Vs 1) _______________

Moses’ mother hid him for three months. How difficult do you think that would be? Babies are notorious for ____________. (Well, I suppose you could put a lot of words in that blank! But they cry.) And to keep a baby quiet while you are living in a tent, surrounded by other people, is a step of faith! Hebrews 11:23 says they hid him by faith. This was not easy, as all the Egyptians were now Pharaoh’s official spies, watching for babies to be drowned. These parents were not afraid of the government, they feared the Lord. I suppose that’s a lesson all of its own! If you had to write the concluding statement in a sermon about Hebrews 11:23 and Exodus 2:2, what would it be? __________________________________________________  __________________________________________________________________________

Verse 2- Jochabed had a son and she saw that he was a _____________________ child, and she hid him for three months. Different versions have different words. 

Using the blueletterbible.org, and toggling to different versions of the Bible (right next to the search bar-it doesn’t matter which version you choose, just explore a few), what other words do you see that describe how Moses’ mother saw him? 
______________________________________________________________________NIV- fine; KJV- goodly, CSB- beautiful…

Don’t all mothers look at their children and think they are the most beautiful things? Of course! 
Whatever word you found, go back to blueletterbible.org and find out what that word actually is and means. (H2896) ___________________________________________________________

Looking to the past, this is an association between Moses and the Genesis account of creation. After creating everything, God said it was “good”, tov.  Moses’ birth is under divine influence. 

In verse 3. She hides him in a papyrus ______________, coats it with ________________ and ______________, and sets him in the reeds of the Nile. 

I’m sure when I was a teenager there were times when my parents wanted to put me in a boat and ship me down the river, but a baby? A 3-month-old baby? And to put your baby in the same waters where the Egyptians were drowning other Hebrew babies must have been heart-wrenching. Do you think she saw the other babies while she was saving her son? 

I suppose Jochabed was officially obeying the letter of the law when she put her son in the waters of the Nile, but she was also most certainly defying Pharaoh’s orders in the way she did it. She was trusting in the providence of God, and God did not fail her. 

There are only two places in Scripture that mention the word tevah. One is the vessel that Noah built, and the other is the basket vessel in which Moses was placed. 

Both arks: In Genesis, mankind would be eliminated by a flood of water- but God saved Noah and his family safely in the tevah to ride atop the water. In Exodus, all Israelite male babies would be eliminated by being drowned in the Nile, but God make sure that the deliverer of Israel was saved in a tevah to ride atop the water. 

This is not an allegory. It is a pattern. God used water and an ark as the early elements of the types of salvation. The first was to save mankind. The second was to save the Hebrews. 

Here’s the beautiful thing, and I hope this blesses you. I love that God would build an ark for just one - just one! This is why the angels rejoice when just one comes to know the Lord. It is the beauty of the salvation of one! 

When Pharaoh’s daughter came to the Nile to perform her religious practices, she saw the basket, heard the baby cry, and all her maternal instincts told her to rescue the child and care for him. God used a baby’s tears to control the heart of a powerful princess. And then He used Miriam’s words to arrange for the baby’s mother to raise the boy- and get paid for it! Pharaoh paid for the deliverer to be raised in a godly home. God works in amazing ways! 

The Bible doesn’t give us Moses’ exact age when Jochabed had to give him up, but in general, an infant was nursed until five years of age. In tribal societies today, the average age of weaning is closer to 6-7 years old. If that was the case, Moses would have known his family well, had a good grasp of the Hebrew language, and been firmly rooted in his faith. (Train up a child in the way they should go, and when they are old they will not depart from it. Proverbs 22:6).

When God wants to accomplish a mighty work, He often starts by sending a baby. It was true for Isaac, Joseph, Samuel, John the Baptist, and especially Jesus. God can (and does) use the weak thing to defeat the mightiest enemies (1 Cor. 1:25-29). A baby’s tears were God’s first weapon in His war against Egypt.

A word to the moms out there. Jochabed had faith to hide him, but it wasn’t over. Because when Moses grew up, became the son of another woman. And not just any other woman, a foreign woman, an idolater, an Egyptian who believed in a bunch of gods that didn’t exist. It’s not how she raised him. But Moses belonged to God more than he belonged to Jochabed.

God’s ways are not ours. Egypt would seem like the least likely place for God to start training a leader. But God did it in several ways: 

- Moses was highly educated (Acts 7:22). Egypt was the leader in the areas of engineering, mathematics, and astronomy. We, also, should learn all we can, and dedicate it to the Lord as we serve Him. 

- Moses failed. He was confused about his racial identity (he was a Hebrew, but raised by Egyptians). He killed an Egyptian- probably also saving a Hebrew’s life. Then he fled for his life. Moses was sent to the Midian desert for 40 years. He needed to learn that deliverance would come from God’s hand, not Moses’ hand. Moses’ first 40 years he tried to be something. In the next 40 years, God is going to show him that he is nothing. In the following 40, God is going to show him that God can take nothing and make something with him. 

- Time passed. Have you felt like you are in a holding pattern?  God’s delays aren’t evidence of His unconcern. He hears our cries, feels our sorrows, and remembers His covenant. But Moses was being prepared to be used by God. 

Read Exodus 2:24-25.  How can you relate to that?

&nbsp;
# Day 3 &middot; _What’s in a name?_

Read Exodus 3. 

Moses is now a shepherd. He did not own his own flock, as he was tending his father-in-law’s flock. Most likely, Moses learned the art of shepherding from his wife and her sisters. Growing up in Pharaoh’s house, shepherds were reviled. So Moses most likely didn’t have anything to do with them in Egypt. 
Think of the differences between who he was in Egypt and who he is now. What differences in his lifestyle can you think of? 

---

Now, do you remember back in Genesis 46, when Joseph brings his family to the land of Goshen? Finish the sentence from verse 34, “all shepherds are _______________________ to the Egyptians.”

He was pampered in Egypt, now he has the job that he had grown to despise. Yet, this is preparation for his future. He’s going to find it extremely valuable. Spending time on this mountain is going to be helpful because he will lead the children of Israel to that same topography.  He’s also leading sheep…which is not far from leading people! He is also learning humility. 

This was a day like all the previous days in the 40 years he’d been in this desert. Note: when God moves in your life, you won’t get an advanced warning. Has that ever happened to you? Without warning, God starts something new. He doesn’t consult you or give you a dream. Just one day, an ordinary day turns into an extraordinary one. 

I’m pretty sure that Moses wasn’t prepared for what came next…a panel of the Lord was standing inside of a burning bush, calling out his name! If I were Moses, I would have run directly in the opposite direction as fast as I could. But Moses thinks, “Hmmm. That’s strange. I’m going to check it out!” 
In verse 5, God instructs Moses to remove his sandals. Why?

---

Why is the ground holy? Because God was there. And where God is, the place is holy.

The removal of one’s sandals was, and remains, a standard Middle Eastern sign of respect when entering the presence of a king or a god. But God didn’t command Moses to take off his sandals because he was in God’s presence- rather, the ground was holy. (We’ll find out later in the Torah that holiness was something that could be transmitted from person-to-person, person-to-object, or object to object.) Had Moses kept wearing his shoes, he would have transmitted holiness to everything his feet touched. 

God introduces Himself to Moses in verse 6. How does He do that?

---

God is bringing to Moses’ mind the covenant He made with Abraham in Genesis 15. Read verses 13-16. It is over 400 years since God had this conversation with Abraham, and He is about to keep His promise in delivering His people. The Israelites have talked about this covenant for 400 years. 

Have you ever received a promise from God and then had to wait what seems like an eternity for it to come to pass? Are you still in a waiting period? It’s hard, isn’t it? We can’t 

assume that our perception of a long period of God’s silence in our lives means we’ve been forgotten. These periods are actually essential to our spiritual growth. It is our preparation time. God’s purpose in our life will always include a period of divine silence. You should expect it. 

God sees our misery. He hears our cries. He is concerned with our suffering. And He WILL bring you out.
 
I’m sure while God was talking, Moses was “amen”-ing! God says, “I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt.” Moses replies, “Amen!” 
God says, “I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers.” And Moses adds, “Amen.” 

God says he is going to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians. Moses is probably throwing his hands in the air and shouting, “Amen!” 
God is going to lead them to a land flowing with milk and honey. Amen and Amen! 

Then verse 10: “So, now, ________. I am sending ___________ to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.” Pump the brakes! Say WHAT?!!! 

God was on a roll there for a while. He was saying all the things Moses had been dreaming that God would say. God hears. He is going to rescue. The people will be going to a great place. All good stuff. Then God throws in a whammy. But YOU, Moses, have a job to do. 

Who doesn’t want the blessings of God? We want God to hear us. We want God to rescue us. We want to be in a better place. But the whole “service” thing is what stops us. Can’t we just go to church, pray at the altar, and magically walk away with healing, healthy relationships, or revival? We’re not prepared to have a job to do. We just want the Holy vending machine in the sky to pour out blessings. It’s a one-way street. Right? Wrong. 

God is calling Moses to be His instrument of deliverance. This is a God pattern. God’s ways are almost the complete opposite of the way a human would expect.

First, God approaches the one He has chosen. God initiates the contact. Sometimes it’s through a dream or a vision. With Moses, it’s a direct face-to-face confrontation. 

Second, the chosen one is either reluctant or outright refuses the call at first. I’m sure we could name many, many prophets that fit this category. Which one comes to your mind first?

---

Third, the prophet candidate (male or female) returns to society, or wherever God sent them, without concern for the opposition they will receive, and ready to speak with authority to any power that comes against them. And often, the prophet will not receive even the tiniest amount of respect from their former friends and family. 

God is looking for specific characteristics of the people He chooses. God wants someone who doesn’t consider themselves worthy, someone who thinks it is impossible to carry out the task alone. And above all, they must understand that if God doesn’t do it all, it simply can’t happen. 

Let’s get real. 

Are you actively serving in your local church?

What need do you see in your church that you feel unworthy of filling, that you can’t possibly do, that if God doesn’t do it all, it simply can’t happen? 

---

God understood the attributes of the man that He would use to bring His people out of Egypt. Moses did not think he was capable, but God did. 

God may be calling your name to help further His church. He is calling on YOU to be a missionary and share your testimony and bring people to Him. 
What are you waiting for?

# Day 4 &middot; _What’s in your hand?_

Exodus 4 is just a continuation of Exodus 3. We are still in the same conversation between Moses and God at the burning bush. 

Read Exodus 4. 

Moses is a little nervous. God is saying some really great things, but Moses is not buying that he’s “the man to do it.” 
God told Moses in Exodus 3:18 that the people would listen to him. Moses disagreed. So, God, in His mercy, gives Moses signs that he will be able to do this task. 

Write the question God asks Moses in verse 2:

---

What was the first sign that God gave to Moses (verses 2-5)? 

---

Moses was holding a stick, a shepherd’s staff. A shepherd was reviled by the Egyptians; but God is going to use this very symbol to lead Israel. 

When Moses throws his staff on the ground, it became a ____________. Moses ran from it! It is no coincidence that a serpent was used. It was the Egyptian symbol of power and authority. Pharaohs wore the symbol of a golden serpent on their heads. Moses knew this symbol. He was raised as a prince of Egypt. He also was very aware of the symbolism of a shepherd’s staff. 

It is interesting that satan is represented as a serpent, and Jesus is known as the Good Shepherd. A simple shepherd, Moses, is going to grab this serpent, Egypt, by its tail! I don’t know a lot about snakes, but when picking it up, I don’t think I would think to pick it up by its tail. That leaves the most dangerous part open to striking at you. Yet, this is how God instructed Moses to grab it. This sign was directed directly at Egypt. The powerful snake is going to be overcome by a lowly shepherd. 

The second sign (verses 6-7) was:

---

The second sign was directed toward Israel. Moses’ clean hand was inserted into his cloak, but when he pulled it out, it was diseased. Then this defiled and diseased hand was put back into the cloak and became clean. God’s chosen people began pure. God allowed them to become impure in Egypt. But God can redeem. God can take the most defiled person, (or nation) and purify them. 

The third sign (verse 9) was: 

---

The third sign was directed toward the worthless gods of Egypt. The Egyptians had many gods which came from the Nile, but the Nile itself was also a god. Moses is going to turn the Nile water into blood. God is going to prove his complete mastery over the mysterious religious system of Egypt. 

The idea of multiple gods was commonly held. In Exodus 20 we will study the Ten Commandments. The first thing God instructs is: “you shall have no other gods before Me.” The whole world had other gods, hundreds of them. The number of gods a nation possessed corresponded to their assumed wealth and power. So Israel, who worshipped only Yahweh, was considered by other nations to be god-poor because they only had one god. When we see the OT referring to Yahweh as the “God above all gods,” that’s exactly what it meant to the people of that day. To us, we see that statement as a declaration of grandeur, or we make it mean that God Almighty is more important than anything else in our lives. While that it all true, that is not what it meant to the early Hebrews. To them, the idea of one god being better and higher than other gods was quite literal.

We have to put ourselves in the mindset of those times. This is not allegory. God Almighty being above all other gods is exactly what it meant. 
We can think of ourselves as superior in our thinking, but don’t do that. Israel was in the beginning stages of their walk with the Lord. Remember when you first accepted Christ? 

Where were you? What has the situation? 

---

God found you right where you were- in your mess. We didn’t get our lives all together and then accept Christ. Just as it has taken us time and a lot of hard lessons, it will take time and hard lessons for Israel to comprehend the basic concept that there is but one God. Not just one God for Israel, but one God period. One God over everyone and everything. This was against their basic understanding of the way the world worked. 

What was it that God made you see differently when you got saved? 

---

In verse 10, Moses gives one last ditch effort in not accepting God’s calling on his life. What was it? 

---

Jewish tradition says that Moses most likely had forgotten how to speak Hebrew well. Others think that with 40 years in the desert, he didn’t know Egyptian well enough to approach the king. This is most likely a better interpretation because it’s hard to imagine that Moses spoke Hebrew to the Pharaoh. 

God responded with anger! Moses had no idea who God was about, what His purposes were, or how powerful He was. So God began at the beginning. What questions did God ask Moses (vs.11)? 

---

What did God promise Moses in verse 12? 

---

After God’s promise, what was Moses’ response (vs 13)? 

---

Wrong answer. God is going to have his older brother Aaron speak for him. So, God spoke to Moses, Moses spoke to Aaron, and Aaron spoke to Pharaoh and to the people. God saw Moses as special. He was not just another Bible character, as we see him today. He was given the power to work miracles and speak as if he were God. What an incredible responsibility! No wonder he didn’t want the job. 

Would you want that job? 

---

What would the pros and cons be on being in Moses’ shoes?

---

Moses ultimately makes the right decision; he is going to obey God. Moses gets approval from his father-in-law, Jethro, to leave and confront Pharaoh. This is customary, as Jethro was the head of the house in which Moses lived. 

In verse 19, the LORD tells Moses it is safe to go back to Egypt. Why? 

---

God knew that Moses would be afraid of those people. God knows our thoughts. He chose to comfort Moses in this situation. Has God ever comforted you? How? 

---

The LORD speaks to Moses early on his trip to Egypt. He is going to tell Moses what is going to happen. Read the end of verse 21. What do you think about what God said regarding Pharaoh’s heart? 

---

If you are having a hard time with God hardening Pharaoh’s heart, step in line. Many people have been troubled by it. Is it fair? What chance did Pharaoh have to do the right thing? Did God make Pharaoh incapable of obeying Him? Does God do this now? 

We have to look to scripture to get our answers. In both Exodus 4:21 and Exodus 7:3-4 God is speaking prophetically. This is something that will happen in the future. This was going to happen and God thought Moses needed to be forewarned, or he would become discouraged. God was going to use Pharaoh’s already rebellious heart for His purposes. This is a great moment to mention that God can use anyone for His purpose. 

There are some people who need to learn the hard way. Do you know one? Are you one? Change sometimes only happens when our pain is so great, and when we are so low that we can only look up to God. Sometimes God hardens hearts so they can more easily see Him. 

Our hearts can be hardened because, like Pharaoh, we are already rebellious. It’s not God’s will that any should perish, but that doesn’t mean that a vast amount of humans will not perish. We know that the path to destruction is wide. When we resist listening to the LORD, our heart  hardens a little more…it’s a slow fade, but it’s a fade.

Judges 16:20 is one of the saddest verses in the Bible. Samson was set apart to be used by God. But after a lifetime of living his own way, when he was the most ensnared by sin, the Bible says that “he did know know that the LROD had left him.” It was a slow fade away from the perfect will of God. 

LORD, keep us in your perfect will. Keep our hearts soft toward Your voice. Help us to listen and obey the first time.

# Day 5 &middot; _The name of the LORD_

Read Exodus 5-6:1.

Record how many times you read the word LORD and God in this chapter. _____________

Does that surprise you? 

Every ancient culture believed in multiple gods and a spirit world. Every culture had a similar set of gods, but their names varied. But knowing each god’s name was all-important to the ancient mind. Knowing a god’s name was the key to communicating with that god and persuading that god to do what was desired. 
Here, Pharaoh is not wondering if there is a “God of the Hebrews”, he has just never heard of Yahweh. Since he has not ever heard of Yahweh, he wasn’t sure where this God even fit into the hierarchy of all the Egyptian gods. So if Pharaoh had never even heard of this God, why should he be concerned about him? After all, this God only revealed His name to mankind only a few weeks prior. And now this God is demanding something of Pharoah? And the demand is that the Hebrew slaves need to make a “pilgrimage festival to Me.” Really? Put yourself in Pharaoh’s shoes right now. Would you believe Moses?

Pharaoh is not buying it. These Hebrews did not belong to this “God”…they belong to Pharaoh! Pharaoh does not deny that there is a god called Yahweh, and he doesn’t not deny that this was Israel’s God. He just doesn’t know what it has to do with him. 

There were many Egyptian gods, so why worry about one little god of a bunch of slaves? If this god was so powerful, how could His people be slaves in the first place? Nothing to worry about here. The Hebrews just have too much time on their hands. 

Moses and Aaron tell Pharaoh that if they don’t obey that (verse 3) “God may

They may have embellished what God actually told them a bit. I mean, they are standing in front of the most powerful man in the known world. 

You can hear the laughter in Pharaoh’s voice as he tells them to get back to work. He has no intention of letting 3 million of the finest craftsman in Egypt, who did the bulk of the building, go on a three-day holiday. If he allows this now, it will set a precedent that he did not want repeated. 

What does Pharaoh make them do in verse 7-9?

[BRICK MAKING IN EGYPT. Painted on the walls of the Theban tomb of Rakhmire (mid-15th century B.C.E.), who was the Egyptian vizier (or prime minister), these realistic scenes depict slaves manufacturing mud-bricks. Included are all stages of brick making (bottom, left to right): fetching of water, kneading of clay, and carrying of moistened clay to brick makers. The top register depicts (right to left): forming of the bricks using a mold, turning of formed bricks out of a mold, and leaving the bricks to dry in the sun. Straw, which is added to the clay mix as opening material, does not appear. Photo: Kairoinfo4u; CC BY-NC-SA 2.0]

How did the Hebrew overseers react to Pharaoh not giving them straw (verses 15-21)?

Boy, they turned on Moses pretty quickly. They went from praising God to calling on God to judge Moses by punishing him. They knew in advance how this would go. Moses already told them. They did not count on any consequences. Following God always has consequences. 

Have you ever had to pay a consequence for following God?

---

He completely understood why the Hebrews were upset. 

What did Moses do when he did not understand what was happening (verse 22)?

---

He returned to the LORD. He didn’t stamp his feet. He didn’t shake his fist at God. And even if he did, who would blame him? But Moses was learning that there is a price to pay for obedience. Oh, that we could learn that lesson. Obedience and sacrifice go hand-in-hand. We will see this throughout all of scripture. 

What have you sacrificed because of your obedience to God?

---

Here’s the best part. Read Exodus 6:1. Moses asks for an explanation, and God answers Moses: I’ve got it all under control. Maybe you need to hear that one statement today. God’s got this.
