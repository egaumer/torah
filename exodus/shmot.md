# SH'MOT &sdot; שמות 
**“Names”** *1:1–6:1*

&nbsp;
# Day 1 &middot; _The Jewish Problem_

The word Sh'mot means _“names”_. This portion is named because the book begins with the phrase _“These are the names (Sh'mot) of the sons of Israel…”_ The English name Exodus comes from the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible. It means _“departure.”_ The book opens with the children of Israel in slavery. It seems God has forgotten them - but He has not. 

Read [Exodus 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1&version=CJB).

Up until this point, most of the Israelites had become wealthy, numerous, and politically powerful in Egypt. But that was going to change. There was a new sheriff in town. His first job was to dismantle any foreign influence that could threaten Egypt. The Hebrews were going to have a radical reversal of fortunes. 

Contrary to popular belief, the Hebrews were not slave laborers in building the pyramids. The pyramids were already in place when Jacob arrived in Egypt. They are used to make mud bricks to create waterways and canals and build cities. 

Egypt at this time was magnificent. They had irrigation systems in the Nile, making it the breadbasket of the world- although their rainfall was almost non-existent. They had wealth, beautiful land, and art. It was a beautiful place.

When the Hebrews longed for their life in Egypt, they didn’t miss the forced labor, they missed the certainty of food, shelter, and being a part of a familiar culture. 

From the close of Genesis to the beginning of the book of Exodus, 350 years have passed. I am sure that the Hebrews felt that God had abandoned them.

?> Exodus 1:1</br>
*“These are the names of the sons of _______________ who went to Egypt with ________________ each 
with his family.”*

The book of Exodus mentions both of his names in the first verse. The Jewish people are “the sons of Israel.” 

[Exodus 1:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A2&version=CJB) is a list of names. Read them. Go on, read them all. Why read names? We don’t really care about names…unless, of course, it was YOUR name on that list! Jesus said the good shepherd calls his sheep by name and leads them out. So these names are very important. These are groups of very distressed people who are being called out by God from Egypt to the Promised Land. 

Way back in [Genesis 12:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+12%3A2&version=CJB), God says to Abraham, _“I will bless you and make you a great nation.”_ A few chapters later in [Genesis 15:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+15&version=CJB), God calls Abraham and says, _“Come outside. Look at those stars. Your descendants will be as numerous as the stars and sands of the earth. I’m going to make you a mega nation!”_ And that’s exactly what God did. Because God keeps His promises. 

Do you remember how many people came to Egypt with Jacob? ([Gen 46:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+46%3A27&version=CJB)) ___________________

By the time we get to [Exodus 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+12&version=CJB), there will be over 600,000 men (ages 20-50, not including women and children.) Estimates are between 2-3 million people. That’s some big numbers!

In [verse 6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A6&version=CJB) it tells us that Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died. We can think of this generation as the Egyptian immigrant generation, the refugees. Their experience in Egypt was very different from the second and third generations of Israelites. Joseph’s generation survived the great famine and thought of their stay in Egypt as temporary. The next generation did not think of going back to Canaan at all. Egypt was the only place they knew, and it was a comfortable life. They were wealthy, numerous, and had political power. Why go back to Canaan? 

[Verse 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A7&version=CJB) is the end of this golden era. 

#### A New Ruler

How quickly we forget our own history. In our very own country, we are experiencing this in tremendous ways. We have a generation of Americans who really don’t know our history as one nation under God. How do you see this happening in the year you are living today?

[Verse 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A8&version=CJB): “Then a 
&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; king, to whom Joseph meant
&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;, came to power in Egypt.”

This king forgot his own history. He had no intention of honoring the deals that the previous pharaohs had with the Israelites. Mostly because this new king was Egyptian, the first Egyptian ruler of Egypt in a very long time.

Why did he change his mind about the Israelites ([vs 9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A9-10&version=CJB))?

Do you think God was saying, “Oh no! What do I do now?” God is sovereign and He is in control. Sometimes it doesn’t seem that way. 

Have you been in a moment when you thought that this is the time the God lost control? Did you need to be reminded that He is sovereign? Do you now? What is it that happened when you thought that maybe this was the time God lost control of your life?

God and Satan have an ongoing battle. What God calls “good”, satan calls “bad.” God counted the fruitfulness of Israel as a blessing. Pharaoh counted it as a curse. There is still a battle between good and evil today. 

The Pharaoh hated the Israelites, but also needed them, as they were key to the Egyptian economy. What was the solution? Control them. Keep their population under control and don’t let them leave. 

1. Break the backs of the adults so they don’t have any stamina (they also won’t be able to revolt).

This God pattern is something we see today as well. The more that God’s people are persecuted, the more fruitful they become! Israel never grew faster, the church never grew faster, then the under the worst persecution. If Israel had given up and decided to fully assimilate into Egyptian culture, they may have avoided persecution…but they would have also opted out of being so fruitful. 

Why does this happen? Because persecution against Christians will separate the chaff from the wheat. Whenever there is persecution, when you have to pay a price for believing in Christ, fewer people will believe. There’s no bandwagon effect anymore. As long as the church takes the easy road, the more the world will avoid persecution…but we will also be less effective and less fruitful. It’s just the way God’s economy works. 

2.  Kill the newborns.

What was the Pharaoh’s plan for the Hebrew midwives ([vs 15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A15&version=CJB))?

When you think of it, this plan was ridiculous. If he actually succeeded in this infanticide, he would only be reducing his workforce. But sometimes the devil doesn’t think that far in advance. 

What were the two midwives’ names?

---

What was Pharaoh’s name in Exodus?

---

The Bible only refers to him as Pharaoh. Yet, these two insignificant women are mentioned by name. How beautiful is that? 

Being a midwife was one of the few professions open to women. It was respected and valued. They assisted in labor, cut the umbilical cord, washed and rubbed the newborn in salt, and in the case of twins, they testified to which one was born first (for the all-important [firstborn blessing](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Firstborn_(Judaism))). They did not have children of their own because their full-time position was to help the birthing to others who were having babies. 

Shiphrah and Puah were probably the supervisory midwives, which is why Pharaoh specifically summons them. These women were most likely not Hebrews because Pharaoh couldn’t have expected a Hebrew to kill their fellow Hebrew children. Second, in [verse 19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A19&version=CJB), they knew something about Egyptian birthing processes. Egyptian mothers would not employ a Hebrew midwife.

The Bible has these two women as heroines. What other women in the Bible were used by God? 

---

Pharaoh wanted the newborn sons to die. And God never forgot this. He didn’t let it go. In fact, the ultimate and final plague upon the Egyptians is the death of their
&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;. Pharaoh tried to kill all the male children to eradicate the race, and it will be the final plague upon Egypt. 

But the midwives feared God more than they feared man. The government gave them a command- a death sentence for children. These women, however, believed in something called the sanctity of human life. Even though it was acceptable and allowed- even commanded- by the government, they didn’t do it. They didn’t riot or picket the palace. They just obeyed God. This is the first instance of civil disobedience in the Bible. They disobeyed the government. The government gave them a law, but they didn’t do it. God’s law supersedes human law, every time. 

In [Acts 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+4&version=CJB) and [5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+5&version=CJB), a law was passed that the Gospel could not be preached publicly. It was illegal. So what did Peter and John do? They shared the Gospel with everyone. Why? Because Jesus had given them the law in [Mark 16:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+16%3A15&version=CJB): 

---

What happened to these midwives? [Exodus 1:19-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1%3A19-20&version=CJB):

---

God provided them with children of their own! They would get to see their own babies born! God is telling them, “I know you. I love you. And I am going to bless you for your obedience.”
