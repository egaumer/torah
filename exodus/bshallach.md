# _B'shallach_ &sdot; בשלח
Parashah 16 &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; _After he had let go (_ 13:17&mdash;17:16 _)_

The sixteenth reading from the _Torah_ is named _B'shalach_ (בשלח)<sup>[H7971](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7971/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H7971")</sup>, which means “when he sent.” The title comes from the first verse of the reading, which can be literally translated to say, “And it happened when Pharaoh sent out the people.” The reading tells the adventures of the Israelites as they leave Egypt, cross the Red Sea, receive miraculous provision in the wilderness, and face their first battle.

# Day 1 &middot; _I've Been Redeemed_

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Romans 6:15-18.

We are all slaves to something. Some people are slaves to their jobs- they are driven by it. You can be a slave of what you own. You can be a slave to what you don’t own, but you do everything you can so you can own it. That’s slavery. Are you a slave to other people’s opinions? I’m not sure the “like” button on Facebook did anyone any favors. Some people are a slave to getting other people’s approval.

How do they affect your life and relationship with God? 

As we go through Exodus, we are going to see the children of Israel are redeemed out of Egypt. They have been taken out of Egypt, but Egypt has not been taken out of them. Some of them want Egypt back. Do you know anyone like that? 

&nbsp;

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Exodus 13:1-16.

&nbsp;

The first thing the LORD says to Moses is, `“Consecrate to me every firstborn male. The first offspring of every wombamong the Israelites belongs to me, whether human or animal.”`

?> <span style="font-size: x-large"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Question 2** </span><br/><br/>Given the circumstances of chapter 12, why do you think this is so significant? 

This idea of redemption is important in the Bible, and it shows how God saves and delivers people. It's a bit hard for people to understand, even today. In the Bible, the firstborn refers to the first son born in a family, whether animal or human. Back then, fathers would pay money to a priest to "redeem" their sons within a month of their birth by bringing an animal to sacrifice. 

It was God who spared the firstborn. God said, “Israel is my firstborn.” God spared Israel. None of the firstborns of the children of Israel were taken in the last plague, so this makes sense. If God spared the firstborn to save the future of the nation, it only makes sense that you would consecrate (dedicate something as sacred) your firstborn to God. Later, we’ll see the concept of “first fruits” or the firsts of what you grow on a piece of property. That belongs to the Lord. 

God is setting a precedence. God redeemed us and He wants the very best of what we have. This is also a New Testament principal. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 6, “You are not your own. You were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.” Yes, we’ve been set free…but we haven’t been set free on our own recognizance. We’re owned by God. 

This process of redemption is going to set up a God principle that we’ll see over and over in Scripture. In Egypt, the firstborn sons were marked for death, but in Israel, they were set apart for a special purpose to serve God. The firstborns in Egypt were sacrificed and ransomed to redeem Israel, but in Israel, they were sacrificed to God for service, and then they were bought back through a substitution. 

For example, when Abraham was going to sacrifice his son Isaac, God redeemed Isaac by providing a ram as a substitute, and Isaac was spared. The Passover was a “type” of this example- Isaac was not killed. So, redemption involved substitution (a life for a life), where something or someone takes the place of another. So, redemption involves someone taking the place of another. 

Verse 8, `“On that day tell your son, ‘I do this because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.’”` Is that not the most beautiful thing? God is telling us, “Give your personal testimony to your children. Look what God has done for me!

There have been so many times when parents have come to dedicate their children to the LORD at church. We ask them, “How did you come to Christ?” 

“Wait. This isn’t about me. I just want to bring my kid to church. I mean. I had a kid, and that’s what I’m supposed to do, right?”

"Well… Have you accepted Jesus into your life?” If you’re just dragging your kid to church, they are going to see ‘hypocrite’ every time they look at you. What has the LORD done for YOU?!

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: x-large"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Question 3** </span><br/><br/>What are some strategies for sharing our personal testimonies with others, particularly with our children?

&nbsp;

Verse 9 brought about an interesting tradition. `“This observance will be for you like a sign on your ____ and a reminder on your ____ that this law of the Lord is to be on your lips. For the Lord brought you out of Egypt with His mighty hand.”`

Because of this verse, around the time of the Babylonian captivity (586 BC) many Orthodox Jewish men wear these little boxes on their heads and on their hand. They are called “tefillin” (Google images). The meaning in Hebrew is “prayers.” In the New Testament they were called “phylacteries.” In this little box were portions of scripture (Exodus 13:1-10, Exodus 13:11-16, Deuteronomy 6:4-9 and Deuteronomy 11:13-21). The Jewish men wrap these every morning as they give their morning prayers because they believe, quite literally, that God’s word should be on their head and hand. (Note: the Torah does not mention the word tefillin, nor does it specify that this “sign” must be a physical object.) I have one that I will share with you at our meeting.

What’s going on with verse 13? It’s very simple. A donkey is an unclean animal. You cannot use a donkey to sacrifice to the _Lord_ under any circumstance. So, you redeem it. You can use the donkey that is the firstborn by sacrificing a lamb in its place. Then you can bring your donkey home - like driving home a pickup truck for work. 

God makes it perfectly clear that there is not an option but to redeem firstborn sons. Human life must be redeemed, which involves a price. The substitution must be a male and must be a firstborn. Did you see it? This is setting up the entire premise for Jesus’ substitutionary death for us- and it’s not an option. To this day, based on Numbers 18:16, Jewish fathers pay five shekels to redeem their firstborn sons. They go to a Rabbi, with 10 men as witnesses. The Rabbi will ask them, “Do you want to keep the money or do you want to keep your son?” Of course they will say, “I want my son.” And that’s the redemption of the firstborn son. 

Here’s the interesting thing, while God was redeeming the firstborn sons, other cultures around Israel were killing theirs. Yes, you heard that right. The Phoenicians sacrifices their firstborn son to their false god and goddesses. They said it would bring honor to their god. God never wanted that. He hated child sacrifice, and still hates it today. Our culture still practices child sacrifice, but it often happens before birth in the form of abortion. God says, “NO! Don’t do that! They are mine! Redeem them!”

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Exodus 13:17-22.

God did not take the Israelites on “the way of the Philistines” - that was the northern route and a straight shot to Canaan. But it was also the most used route by travelers. Had they gone that route, it would have taken them approximately 2-3 weeks to get to the Promised Land. Anyone remember how long it actually took them? Yeah… 40 years! That’s a big difference! 

So why wouldn’t God take them the fastest way? Because He was gracious. All along that route, from Egypt to the north were many military outposts that would monitor any movement from Egypt or incoming traffic. These Egyptian fortresses also monitored and protected from foreign invasion. There would have been many companies of soldiers there. And, if they went the way of the Philistines, guess who they would run into? Yep, Philistines! The Philistines were ancient Phoenician fighters, and we’ll discover soon that in the Old Testament they have a long history against the Israelites. Imagine if you would, 3 million people stopping to settle anywhere! The economic and societal impact on any culture would be hard to calculate.

![Exodus Route](https://bible-history.com/images/common/Map-Route-Exodus-Israelites-Egypt.jpg)

These 3 million Israelites were not an army. They were families… and they were carrying a LOT of gold! They weren’t fighters, they were slaves. (Although verse 18 tells us that they went up out of Egypt “ready for battle.” They just hadn’t had to fight yet…be patient, they will!)

God was saving them from coming up against an army and giving up, returning to a life in Egypt. (Really, what could be more human?) God knows what we can handle. He knows what you can take, and will not give you too much so it will break you. Although it may feel like it sometimes! Can I get an AMEN?

God is going to use their weakness to show His great strength. They are going into a wilderness and will have to depend on God. There is no food. No water. Read Deuteronomy 8:2. 

Verse 19 - They took Joseph’s bones with them. The cool thing is that Joseph was a dreamer, always looking to the future. And 360 years before this event, when Joseph was prime minister of Egypt, he was already seeing the future of the Exodus! He wanted to be a part of the time when God would give the children of Israel a new land! 

Verse 21: `“By day the LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of ____ to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of ____ to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night.”` This was God’s GPS system. The cloud would not only be a visible guide, but would also provide shade in the hot desert sun. And fire big enough for everyone to see would also provide light to still be able to move and heat for the desert cold. God’s guidance system was also temperature controlled! God thought of everything! 

Now the cloud was also representing the Shekinah glory. Later in Exodus this cloud will settle upon the tabernacle. We’ll see this cloud many times, actually. In 1 Kings 8, it will settle on the temple of Solomon. In Isaiah, God is high and lifted up and `“the train of his robe fills the temple”`. And `“the temple was filled with smoke”`. In Ezekiel 10 the cloud filled the temple. 

And in Revelation 1:7 it says, `“‘Look, he is coming with the clouds,’ and ‘every eye will see him,even those who pierced him’; and all peoples on earth ‘will mourn because of him.’ So shall it be! Amen.”`

# Day 2 &middot; _The Red Sea_

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Exodus 14. 

How did Pharaoh know where the Israelites were? Well, 3 million people, plus hundreds of thousands of animals are not easy to hide. The Israelites were not blazing a new trail, they were taking well-known routes. Egyptian scouts would report back using smoke signals, signal fires, and reflecting light off of shiny objects. 

Immediately after they are on their way, God tells the Israelites to change their course so Pharaoh will think they have lost their way. They must have felt very vulnerable, “Why are we turning? This looks like a trap. Moses, are you sure we’re going the right way? Are we there yet?” Pharaoh knew that the path they were taking would trap them. They seemed to be “wandering aimlessly” and the desert had “closed in on them.” From a strategic military point of view, Egypt had them trapped. But God is luring the Egyptians into a trap because yet, once again, Pharaoh has hardened his heart. He thought he was above God. He wanted these Hebrews back dead or alive, but he wanted them. 

But Pharaoh has done what the prophet Zechariah warns must never be done: In Zechariah 2:8 he warns: `“for whoever touches you [Israel] touches the apple of his eye.”` Basically, touching God’s eyeball. Have you ever got dust in your eye? You’d do anything to protect that eye. Whoever touches Israel messes with God. 

God is drawing Pharaoh to destruction like a moth to a flame. This is a pattern that will be repeated at Armageddon. Here’s the bittersweet truth: the LORD will mark some for life and some for death. Some will be a ransom for others. This is the _Lord's_ decision. Yes, He wants all to be saved, but He also knows who will and who won’t be saved. This is a hard thing to come to terms with. All I can say, is that God is God, and we are not. 

Pharaoh “hitched” his chariot. He was so anxious to pursue the Israelites that he prepared his own chariot instead of taking the time to get a servant to do it for him. Archeological evidence documents chariots were invented shortly before Pharaoh’s time. Thus, they would have been seen as among the most, if not the most, advanced military weapons of all time. Typically, an Egyptian chariot had three people in them, a driver and two people to fight. 

On the heels of the Israelites joyful freedom, they soon found themselves filled with fear when they saw the army approaching. They were terrified and cried out to the LORD. Great job! Yes! That’s exactly what they should be doing when they are afraid. But wait, they turn praying to the Lord to complaining against God’s representative. That’s what people do. When they have an issue with God, they take it out on God’s representative. If any pastors are reading this, I’m sure you can “Amen” this section several times over! 

What are the Israelite’s eyes seeing right now? I’m sure the Hebrew watchman spotted the Egyptian army in the distance. Soon, everyone saw it and were hysterical. They are seeing the dust of the army of Egypt rising before them. But wait. That’s not all they’re seeing. They have seen God’s power in the past. They cried out to God and God gave them Moses and Aaron. They just saw 10 (count them), 10 miraculous judgments on Egypt and they were spared from them! They saw that with their own eyes. They now see a pillar of fire by night and a cloud by day. They are seeing this...on that very day! Butthey still see the cloud of dust on the horizon. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: x-large"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 2 &#8729; Question 1** </span><br/><br/>Which cloud are you looking at? 

&nbsp;

We have the ability to see both clouds. But which one are you looking at right now? There is a giant pillar of clouds close to you, guarding you, protecting you. And there is a small cloud of dust of the enemy in the horizon. Sometimes we focus on the wrong thing. God promised them that they would leave Egypt and would worship Him at Mount Sinai. Are they there yet? No. But there is a promise, and there is a cloud in front of them that is reassuring them that God has not forsaken them. Why is it that human nature focuses on the horizon and not on the promise? 

Yes, God led them into that hardship. God led them into that vulnerable spot. Why? Why would he do that? Because He wants us to grow a bit. There are lessons that you can only learn in the midst of a storm, and not when the water is calm with the sun shining.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: x-large"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 2 &#8729; Question 2** </span><br/><br/>Are you in a spot where you can’t see any way at all? Are you focused on the crises or the Christ? 


&nbsp;

The Israelites’ complain is sarcastic in verse 11. If any nation had enough graves, it was Egypt, whose entire religion revolved around death. They went from praying to preying on God’s servant. But let’s remember that this is a nation of spiritual infants. They are just learning to walk with God. This is all new to them. 

The Israelites claim they would rather return to slavery than fight the Egyptians for their freedom. To be fair, this is understandable. Most people would rather be enslaved than dead. Most, but not all. Patrick Henry, made one of the most famous statements of the American War of Independence when he said, “Give me liberty, or give me death.” 

Moses is unshaken. He fires back at them in verse 13, `“Do not be afraid.”` He addresses the real issue here, their fear. Fear can swallow up faith just like faith can swallow up fear, they’re mutually exclusive. Moses goes to the heart of the ideas and tells them to stop it, don’t be afraid. Then he says something crazy. He says, `“Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the LORD will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again. The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.”` 

If he said, “Run like the wind, Bullseye!” that would have made more sense! But stand still? Don’t you hear the chariots and see the horses? The Israelites flesh was screaming, RUN! 

How hard is it to stand still? When everything is in chaos, standing still is not our natural response. When Jesus was in the Garden of Gethsemane with His disciples, did Peter stand still? Nope! He grabbed a sword! 

God is going to do this totally amazing thing. Stand still. Watch it! Burn it into your memory. You’re going to be talking about this for a long time! 

Then Moses talks to God again and He tells Moses- “It’s time to move on.” Move? Where? We’re hemmed in. The Red Sea is in front of us, the Egyptians are behind us. God does not want the Israelites to be completely passive. Crying out to God is fine, but God wants them to move forward.

But first God does something that should sound very familiar to both the Israelites and should scare the pants off of the Egyptians. The cloud gave darkness to the Egyptians and light to Israel. The word for darkness here (blueletterbible.org) is _Chosek_ (חֹשֶׁךְ)<sup>[H2822](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2822/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H2822")</sup>. This should be a familiar word. Back in Genesis 1 there was darkness (_Chosek_) on the face of the deep. This is not just physical darkness. It is also the same darkness in Exodus 10 when darkness covered all Egypt for three days. It is a negative word. It denotes a type of blindness, an evil force, a type of spiritual darkness that is terrifying. But light or in Hebrew, _Owr_ (אוֹר)<sup>[H216](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h216/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H216")</sup> is enlightenment, a positive spiritual force, something that emits truth and goodness. Isn’t that beautiful? Once again, God puts hosek on Pharaoh’s armies and owr on Israel.

&nbsp;

This is not an image of God that we are used to seeing, yet it is biblical. From the same being comes death and darkness for those who oppose Him and light and life for His people. Some of us may not be comfortable with that. Some may want to think, “Well, that’s the God of the Old Testament. The God of the New Testament is fundamentally different. He is only love and mercy.” That’s simply not the case. We are reminded over and over in both the Old and New Testaments that God never changes. God is determined to keep what “belongs to Him.” It doesn’t matter if that is the past, present or future. There is no in-between, no compromise, and God is not changing His mind. 

Let’s just tease out this concept a bit more. The fact that God never changes refers to his character, his attributes. God tells Joshua to drive out or kill all the inhabitance of the land He set aside for His people. But he did not tell Jesus to kill the Romans who occupied the HolyLands. This does not mean he changed. It’s a matter of timing. In the future, Jesus will destroy all those, worldwide, who oppose God in the great battle of Armageddon.

Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind. (Remember in the Genesis study when I said to watch out for the words “east”? This has spiritual implications and often involves the presence of God or a miracle. God makes a way where there seems to be no way. That wind blew so hard it made the bottom sea floor dry. The best research out there says that in order to have 2.5-3 million people cross over a body of water in one night, the area of the march would have to be 1/2 mile wide, 8 miles to cross. Movies make it seem like one person would be able to touch either side of the two halves of water. Not a chance. 

The Egyptians would have seen this. But once all of God’s people were safe, God’s light suddenly broke into the darkness that had held the Egyptians back. Now they were in hot pursuit!

I heard someone say that, “if the Exodus happened at all” then the Hebrews crossed over in shallow mud. It was not that big of a “miracle”. Wow! Really? Then if that’s the case, this was an even BIGGER miracle because every last Egyptian soldier was drowned in those same waters! Now that’s a fantastic miracle! Personally, I don’t have a problem knowing that God did exactly what He said He did. 

God splits the sea through manipulation of nature. God is reminding the Israelites that He controls nature; nature is not a god. 

This scene is a shadow of what is going to happen in the end times. The evil that the world is experiencing will become darker and darker. But suddenly, all will be plunged into heavenly light. Satan and all the demons of hell will not be able to stand in the light of God’s presence. 

Once again, the Egyptians are dead and the children of Israel are alive. The Passover principle is this: either a lamb will die in your place, or you will die for your own sins. The firstborn in Egypt were killed, the parents survived. But every Egyptian soldier that went out after the Israelites that day was not coming home. The Egyptians finally recognized the LORD as God. But it was too late; they drowned with that knowledge.

Pharaoh died in this. Egyptian history tells us that after the death of the Pharaoh (they do not specify what exactly happened) that Egypt was in a state of shock that lasted for decades. It would make a lot of sense if the “Pharaoh” they are speaking of is the Pharaoh of the Exodus. Egypt, now without its leader, the country in complete devastation from the plagues, a quarter of their population leaving all at once… everything would have collapsed. 

This chapter ends with the Israelites fearing the LORD and putting their trust in Moses. But don't hold your breath. It won’t be just a few more days when they lost faith again and the whining and doubt will resurface. We haven’t really changed all that much in 3500 years, have we? 


&nbsp;
# Day 3 &middot; _The First Worship Song_

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Exodus 15: 1-21.

The first twenty-one verses of Exodus are a song- often called _The Song of Moses_. In Hebrew, this song rhymes as a poem. This is the very first song recorded in the Bible! It’s a song of redemption. The children of Israel are throwing a party in the desert! They would have had musical instruments and the entire congregation would sing this song. It was such a hit that it was sung as the closing hymn of every Sabbath service for thousands of years! How’s that for a #1 hit?! 

After they are delivered through the Red Sea and saw the enemy lying dead on the seashore, Moses goes into the Wilderness Recording Studio and recorded this hit song. And the rest of the people of Israel learned it and sang it together. Isn’t it interesting that just a few chapters previous, Moses told God that he couldn’t speak. So what happened? He may not have been brave enough to speak to a crowd, but he sure did know how to write poetry!

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: x-large"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 3 &#8729; Question 1** </span><br/><br/>Just glancing at this poem, what emotionally charged words do you read? I’ll start you off: shattered, smashed… What do you think is the main theme is of this poem?

&nbsp;

The first worship song written was about redemption. Moses’ song of worship is a response to the redemption of the Israelites from the hands of the Egyptians. While they were in Egypt they had no song. They had sighing, groaning, and crying, but they didn’t have a worship song. But their response to God’s deliverance is worship. God turned their mourning into dancing, their sighing into singing. Oh that God would do that for us!

1 John 4:19 says, `“We love because He first loved us”`. God works and we respond. It just makes sense that we worship God because of what He has done for us. Worship needs to come from the heart. Jesus said that the Father is looking for those who worship Him in spirit and in truth. It needs to be real. Worship is when we place God above everyone and everything else. Jesus said in Matthew 22:37, `“Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.”` This means (and it may hurt a little) that God comes before hobbies, before entertainment, before television, before sports, before your children… God is #1.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: x-large"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 3 &#8729; Question 2** </span><br/><br/>Worship needs to be focused. Worship is about God. In these first 18 verses, how many times do you count the word “LORD”? It’s all about Him! Now Moses did a lot of things in this story, but he is not mentioned one time in the song. He was being used by God as an instrument. Worship should be focused on God and not man.

&nbsp;

Yesterday I had a minor operation, the doctor may use many different types of instruments on me. But when the surgery is over, I didn’t say, “Hey, Doc! That was a successful surgery. Show me that scalpel!” Why? Because it’s not about the tool, it’s about the physician! 

We put worship at the front of our Sunday service because we want to start our focus on the LORD. It’s not about padding the time so latecomers can find a parking spot. It is for us to be able to tell God how awesome He is and to thank Him for all He’s done! We GET to do this! What an honor! We should never look at the worship service as extra time we have before the “real” service starts. Worship is getting your heart ready to receive God’s Word. 

Worship is exclusive. It’s about the One True God. Look at verse 11, `“Who among the gods is like you, LORD?”` After the ten plagues, this is a great work of praise to God, the One True God, the Almighty. They have just witnessed it firsthand. You have to remember that for the past 400+ years they were in the Egyptian culture of polytheism. That culture had rubbed off on them. God is going to be cleaning them up now, but they are going to struggle with idolatry for a long time. 

The Israelites were infants in their spiritual maturity. They knew they had a God and He had shown His great power over all of the Egyptian gods. And they knew His name, Yahweh. But they didn’t know much more than that. Not to worry, God is going to introduce Himself to the Hebrews as well! It’s a slow, lifelong process, as it is for all of us. 

Here’s something we need to know about God. He is jealous, and will not stand for any competition with other gods, activities or people that compete for His time. He is not willing to share His spotlight with any other. We do not worship angels, we worship God. In the book of Revelation, John fell down and started to worship an angel. Immediately the angel said, `“Do not worship me. Worship the Lord.”` Do not worship angels, do not worship Mary, or the pastor… God’s worship is exclusive. 

I saw a bumper sticker that said, “God is my co-pilot.” Um… God is no one’s co pilot. He wants total control of the wheel.In fact, he wants ownership of the car, and you! You get the honor of being in the car, but that’s it.

&nbsp;

_Yhwh_ has given the Israelites a tremendous victory over the Egyptians. I’m sure this victory scared a few nations and worried others.Obviously they didn’t have the 6:00 news to watch, but don’t be fooled into thinking that these nations were not very aware of 3 million Hebrews leaving Egypt! AND, it was common knowledge that the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob would want the territory that God gave them. If 3 million people were determined to take the land, along with a God that caused all the chaos and devastation in Egypt, they were most likely very worried.

This song was also prophetic, reminding Israel that even they would be in the midst of hostile nations, _Yhwh_ would be there to protect them.

&nbsp;

From this point on, the narrative will be all about Israel’s time in the wilderness. Israel is going to go from the redeemed infant to the redeemed problem child. 

The wilderness is a strange place to be in. Perhaps you are in this place in your life. It’s not where you came from, nor is it where you are going. It’s the in-between. This is the time when God matures us. The wilderness is our finest teachable moment, when we are the most vulnerable and tender. One of the first struggles was the lack of drinkable water. The children of Israel came Marah, but they couldn’t drink because the water was bitter. They were very upset. When they were in Egypt, Moses told them to take enough water for a 3 day journey because they would get water in an oasis. Three days pass, they are running out of water. They get to the “oasis” but the water is not drinkable. Mind you, there are 3 millionpeople PLUS all of their livestock! Let’s put this into perspective. 

How much water would be needed per day for this group? More than ten million gallons of water per day would be needed! How much is that? The Beijing Olympic Swimming Pool holds 600,000 gallons of water. They would need close to sixteen and a half of those pools full of water per day!

Did God lead them here? Yes, He did. God led them here and they complained. God sent 10 judgements against Egypt and Israel complained. God opened up the Red Sea and killed their enemies…and Israel complained. God led them here to a place with no water and…yep, they complained.

Do you believe that God can lead you into difficult times and places? Jesus made a promise to you that most people don’t have underlined and highlighted in their Bible. John 16:33 says, `“In this world you will have ____”`.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: x-large"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 3 &#8729; Question 5** </span><br/><br/>This is always a shock. God is going to lead you into some interesting places. He might lead you to a Red Sea, or a place of Marah- a place of bitterness. This is why God wants you to live by faith. When you come to a bitter place and there is no water, you can trust God. Maybe your Marah is a lost job, or a bad medical diagnosis. Have you been to Marah? Have you been there more than once?

&nbsp;

Bitterness in the Bible doesn’t mean our western term of an emotion or mental state. Bitterness is a spiritual condition- the opposite of sweet. Bitter means “unbearable pain, usually at the hands of another,” “suffering with no hope of escape.” The root word for bitter is marah- and it’s associated with poison. 

Moses cried out to the LORD and the LORD showed him a piece of wood, which he threw into the water. Suddenly the water became fit to drink. Then God set up a statute (a law or decree) for them in verse 26, `“If you listen carefully to the Lord your God and do what is right in His eyes, if you pay attention to His commands and keep all His decrees, I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the Lord, who heals you”`.

First of all, pay attention to that tiny first word, “if.” If. That little word holds enormous repercussions. This is the beginning of their judicial system, and it’s based on a whole series of “ifs.” There is a big difference between the covenant of Abraham (a vow the God made to Abraham) and the conditional set of rules that God is going to give Moses on Mount Sinai. They are not only conditional, they also come with consequences for breaking the rules. 

Our culture, all of mankind, is in a bitter state. We are unable to save ourselves. Sometimes we can’t even recognize it as bitter. Then came Christ, hung on a piece of wood, where his precious blood was spilled. And when the divine wood is immersed in our lives, our bitterness and oppression are taken away. He transforms our lives from bitter into sweet. This is the picture intended at the spring of Marah in the wilderness. 

How many springs were in Elim?. (There’s that number again. We’ll see this number over and over in Scripture. Can you think of other places where you’ve seen the number 12?

An oasis is coming. You won’t be in this bitterness forever. There is a place of refreshment coming, and you will enjoy it that much more when it balances against the trouble. God redeems his people and they are grateful…then they complain, then they’re grateful, then they complain again. Sound familiar? It should. It’s a picture of us.

# Day 4 &middot; _Manna From Heaven_

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Exodus 16.

God is going to start teaching Israel how to live as a redeemed people- a people bought with the price of a life. The Israelites had just watched the power of God demonstrated. But they’re hungry now. It’s almost as if they had forgotten what they have seen and now feel like they’re hung out to dry and life its’t worth living. With their own eyeballs they saw God open a body of water, provide a cloud for shade during the day and fire for warmth at night. They were given enough water for over 3 million of them, and their animals. But have hunger amnesia. 

We often forget what we should remember and remember what we should forget! We lock our minds on things, and don’t let them go. Hey, unbelief is strong. It can wipe out our entire memory bank of all of God’s mercies and miracles. I know you’ve been there because I have. We have to focus our attention on God, and that’s not always easy to do when we are stressed and hungry.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: x-large"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Question 1** </span><br/><br/>They are 2-months into their wilderness journey and what do they start doing? You guessed it! They start complaining. We are going to see this pattern over and over again. And who are they complaining about this time? Moses and Aaron, their leaders. I wouldn’t have made a good Moses…you probably wouldn’t either. Because when they said, “If only we had died by the LORD’s hand”… I would have shouted, “Amen!” It’s going to get really old for Moses to hear all the complaining year after year. Now we’ve heard this complaint before, but it is a little comical to read it in hind sight. What is their complaint in verse 3?

&nbsp;

This is what you call “Selective Memory Disorder” (err, or that’s what I’m calling it). So, they are saying that as slaves they sat around pots (plural) of meat (rarely fed to slaves) and ate all the food they wanted?! Really? Hmmm. That’s not how I remember them, but, hey, it’s their story. Or is it? Is it not our story as well? When you come to Jesus, and your life was changed, was there something in you that still longed for the “old days”, old friends, old language? That’s Selective Memory Disorder. Satan will remind you of the old days, but he won’t remind you of the dark days when you were in bondage. 

Here’s a fact, the first step in going backwards is looking backwards. When you look back and remember, then please remember the whole truth. Jesus put it this way in Luke 9:62, `“No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.”` It’s for this reason we need to be selective about what people we hang out with, who we partner with in business, who we chose to date or marry. We need to choose people who will encourage us in spiritual things and move us toward Jesus and not away from Him, to help us look forward and not backwards.

I love God’s response in verse 4. He says, `“I will ____ down ____ from heaven for you.”` Isn’t that beautiful? He doesn’t respond with fire and 
brimstone (like I may have). He answers them by taking care of their needs showing them that they can trust Him…He sends Krispy Kreme doughnuts! What a great lesson in God’s grace! Instead of giving them what they deserve He gives them mercy. 

God is also going to set up a really important principal. He will provide for them and satisfy their appetites, but only one day at a time. Each day they 
would gather only what they needed and on the 6th day they would gather double (enough for that day and the Sabbath). 

This manna will be an ongoing test, continual training for them to depend on God. They had to do it every day. They had to trust God every single day. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: x-large"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Question 2** </span><br/><br/>What happened when they didn’t obey and gathered more manna than they needed and kept it till the next day? 

&nbsp;

What’s crazy about the Israelites still not believing that Yahweh was in control is what they had recently seen with their own eyes! Can you recount the things they’d actually witnessed in the past year? And not only that, at that very moment, there was a visible cloud by day and fire by night. This was not of Moses’ doing. But the Israelites still could not fully trust in God. The years of abuse and slavery messed with these people. And it messes with us, as well. Some of us still have trust issues when it comes to God. And God is very lovingly going to give you your needs daily, one day at a time, so you will have to continue to trust Him. 

In verses 10-11, Moses tells the community to come before the LORD and look up to see the glory of the LORD in the &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;. Did that strike you as odd? It did to me. This was the same cloud that had been leading them and protecting them since they left Egypt. It was available for them to see every single day, all day. So why did Moses have to tell the people to stop, look up, and come near to God’s presence? One simple reason. While God’s presence is always available to us, we must choose to draw near to Him. We have to tell our own souls to keep our eyes on Jesus. When the Israelites took their eyes off of the cloud, they did not recognize God’s presence with them and got disoriented.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: x-large"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Question 3** </span><br/><br/>Before we start condemning them, we have to ask ourselves, “Has God ever gone unnoticed in our lives? Have you ever just quit looking to God for help? When?” I think that’s a question we can all say “yes” to. 

&nbsp;

The arrival of the quail is similar to how God dealt with the plagues. He uses a natural elements of His creation in extraordinary ways. God used these quail in a supernatural way to bless His people. Imagine what these people witnessed yet again? They drew near to the LORD and before dark their bellies were full. Then in the morning, after getting a restful night’s sleep, the rising sun revealed an even greater miracle- the gift of manna! 

The Israelites saw it and said, _Mawn_ (מָן)<sup>[H4478](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4478/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H4478")</sup> (What is it?) This is where we get the word manna. There was what looked like frost covering the desert floor. 

Each man was to gather as much as they thought necessary to satisfy themselves. They were told to gather an omer which was about 1/2 gallon per person. When they went to gather, a strange thing happened. It didn’t matter if they gathered more or less than an omer, when they put it in the jar, everyone had exactly the same amount! And it satisfied everyone, large and small, young and old! There was no need to horde or rush to be the first one. There would be enough manna from God for each of them to be satisfied. 

They were to dispose of any leftover manna that they did not eat. God also gave them the same instructions for the Passover lamb- eat your fill, but dispose of the remainder before the morning. The Israelites who ignored this part of the lesson were disgusted to find that their leftover manna was full of maggots and rotten. 

Here’s another lesson for us. We, like these Israelites who ignored God’s full instructions, often only follow the parts of God’s commands that make sense to us, and blow off the rest. This is not about legalism. But God’s blessings can be ruined by our lack of obedience. 

So they gathered every morning. Every man gathered according to his appetite and when the sun came out it melted. Pretty interesting that in the camp of Israel there was no room for a lazy person who just wanted to sleep in. If you didn’t get up and get your daily bread, it would turn into liquid and you’d have another chance tomorrow. There is a spiritual parallel here. Start your day with your daily bread. Get into the Word at the top of your day. If you wait too long, the day gets cluttered and there are too many distractions. One of the ways I do this is to go through the the Bible in a year on the YouVersion Bible app. Here’s what I like: It takes about 10-15 minutes of my day. I can read or listen, or both! Usually, I have my quiet time while I take the dogs out in the morning to go potty. It’s perfect timing. It starts off my day thinking about God’s Word and those thoughts are the first thing in my head. And if you are a competitive person, the app actually tracks your streak (how many days in a row you’ve used the app). 

Here’s the beautiful thing about God giving the Israelites a sabbath. They had just been slaves in Egypt. I’m pretty sure the Pharaoh had never given them a day off, let alone one day every week! But God comes along, feeds them, and gives them a rest every seven days. It’s a new relationship now. This is a new covenant. This is a gift! Imagine if you got a new boss and they demand that you should have extra time off every week with all the perks of full time. We’d jump at that! 

So why is it that when God gives us a day of rest we think of all the things we can do to fill that day with work we didn’t get done earlier in the week? 

Not only did God give them the gift of the Sabbath, He nourished them with bread from heaven. In the orient when people had the same diet every day without change the result was swollen feet. Deuteronomy says that for 40 years this manna gave them enough necessary nutrients: protein, carbs, complex carbs, sugars, etc. that their feet didn’t even swell up! 

Other aspects of manna: it was substantial. It gave them energy all day long. It was nutritional. It was flexible: it could be baked, boiled, souffléd… there were lots of ways to fix manna. It was put into the Ark of the Covenant as a remembrance. It’s good to remember what God has done for you. It doesn’t matter how you do it: keep a journal, vlog, Facebook log, write it in the margins of your Bible…just keep a record. 

Let’s brainstorm all the ways manna is like the Word of God: 

1. It’s given supernaturally. 
2. It has to be eaten & digested internally. It’s actually not healthy to only leave it on the outside of your body. If you want the nutrition, it has to be eaten. 
3. It has to be gathered daily. Think about all the "food" that the world feeds you. It’s 24/7. And you eat it up: pictures, memes, posts, newscasts… if you put a fraction of the time eating God’s Word instead of digesting what the world is giving, your life will change!

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: x-large"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Question ** </span><br/><br/>What other ways do you see manna as the Word of God? 

&nbsp;

In John 6:32-33 Jesus said, `“It is not Moses who has given you the ____ from heaven, but it is my ____ who gives you the ____ ____ from heaven. For the ____ of ____ is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives ____ to the ____”`.

Then John 6:35 and 48 Jesus says, `“I am the ____ of life”`.

In verse 49-51 He tells them, `“Your ancestors ate manna in the wilderness, yet they died. But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die. I am the ____ bread that came down from ____. Whoever eats this bread will live ____. This bread is my ____, which I will give for the ____ of the ____”`. 

The people in Jesus’ day basically told him that when He fed the 5,000 that was pretty cool. He fed everyone. But Moses…Moses did it for 40 years. Jesus only did it once. Wow. Jesus answers them by saying, “Um. Moses didn’t do anything. He watched it happen. He didn’t make it happen. This was from God. Also manna is a physical food that has no value after you die. Your ancestors ate manna, but guess what? They’re dead! Spiritual nutrition does not come from physical bread, it comes from God. And ‘I AM’ the bread of life.” And Jesus won’t fail you. Ever.

# Day 5 &middot; _Confrontation From Within and Without_

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Exodus 17:1-7. Confrontation From Within.

?> <span style="font-size: x-large"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Question 1** </span><br/><br/>If Moses had a playlist, what would it be? On the Road Again? Long and Winding Road? How about, I Can’t Get No Satisfaction? What’s your playlist for Moses?

Let’s review the list of miracles that the Israelites have seen up until this point. On your worksheet list as many as you can think of starting with them being slaves in Egypt. How is it that they have so quickly forgotten all that God had done for them? How is it that they are physically looking at avisible cloud by day and fire by night and have God’s real presence actually with them, and not understand that God is in control? 

The true sign of spiritual growth is being applied to the children of Israel…but also to us. True spiritual growth isn’t how we act in church on Sundays, when life is good. The true test of growth is how we act when the bottom drops out, the water dries up, when food is scarce. 

Once again, they need water. Yes, they are in a desert. Yes, water is necessary for them and their animals. Food is no longer an issue, but water is. But instead of them going to God with their request, they just doubt, fear and complain. They blamed their leaders and _Yhwh_. 

Now Moses had actually led them here. This is strange because Moses was a seasoned desert dweller at this point. He knew the area. Midian was only a few miles from where they currently were. So, it can be reasonable to assume that the water supply that Moses thought he was bringing them to was dried up. This was a potential disaster. This time the people did not see bitter water that could be changed into drinkable water. They saw no water. 

Moses asks them in Exodus 17:2: `“Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the LORD to the ____”` That Hebrew word for _test_ is _Nasa_ (נָסָה)<sup>[H5254](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5254/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H5254")</sup>. It is a judicial word meaning to test, try and prove. The children of Israel are actually trying to put God on trial and sit on the judgement seat as God! In reality, it is them who is being put to the test to see if they’ll trust the LORD or not. 

Moses is also a shadow of the Messiah. He is considered a deliverer, and a law giver. And the very person who is being used as an instrument of deliverance is the one they want to kill. Jesus also came to His own, but His own received Him not. What does Jesus do when they want to kill Him? He gives it all over to God. And that is exactly what Moses does. He asks God for wisdom. 

And once again, God is merciful. He doesn’t rebuke them, He simply provides for them. He tells Moses to take representatives to the rock and use the same staff that Moses held up to part the Red Sea and strike the rock. This was the second time Moses was ordered to strike something with this staff, and both times it had to do with water. The first time he struck the Nile river and it turned to blood. Here, he is striking a rock to produce drinkable water. In one instance the staff was used for wrath upon the enemy, and in another it would be used to provide mercy and protection for His own children.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: x-large"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Question 2** </span><br/><br/>This striking of the rock is another shadow of the Messiah. Christ is called the Rock, and would be broken so He could provide living water for us. See 1 Corinthians 10:1-4. Why do you think Christ is depicted as a rock? 

&nbsp;

Moses strikes the rock with the same staff that at one time became a serpent. Go back to Genesis 3:15. Christ was put on a cross, crucified, and bruised by Satan. 

One more note: later, Israel will again come to a place where there is no water. The LORD will tell Moses to speak to the rock. But Moses was angry, and he struck the rock. And he paid for it. He did not get to enter the Promised Land because he misrepresented God. God wasn’t angry at the people. He was angry with Moses because he gave the impression that God was angry at the people. God said, Speak to the rock. Don’t strike it. You don' have to strike Christ again. He’s already been struck once and for all. It is finished.

&nbsp;

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Exodus 17:8-15. Confrontation From Without.

&nbsp;

Verse 8 suddenly changes the narrative as the people become engaged in battle with a hostile neighbor; The Amalekites. These are the descendants of Amelek. Amelek was Esau’s grandson. Remember him? They were related to Israel, but they were also enemies because of the split of the two brothers Jacob and Esau. The Amalekites are going to be long-time enemies of Israel. 

When it rains, it pours. Moses has just dealt with the confrontation of his own people. And now there is a Middle East conflict happening. 

Moses instructs Joshua (who would eventually become the leader of Israel after Moses’ death) to select men to fight. Moses went up on a hill with Aaron and a man named Hur. In Exodus 24:14, Hur seems to be Aaron’s assistant. Jewish tradition is that Hur was Miriam’s husband. (Miriam is Moses’ and Aaron’s sister.) 

The Israelites are battling two natures. There is the old nature (Amalekites- old hurts, old wounds) and the new nature (when you gave your life to Christ). This is an ongoing battle. When you came to Christ a battle started. The old you wants you back. It is a battle of flesh and spirit. 

Here’s the key. You are either feeding one or the other. If you feed the flesh, the old nature wins. (I’m sure I don’t have to give you examples of how you can feed the flesh.) But I will give you examples of how you feed the spirit: by the Word of God, prayer, and fellowship with other believers. Unless you have to for health reasons, this is not the time to be watching church online. This is crucial that you are fellowshipping and worshipping with other believers together, in the same room where you can lay hands on each other and pray for each other. 

Hebrews 10:25 says, “`And let us not ____ our meeting together, as some people ____, but encourage one another, ____ now that the day of His return is drawing near.”` Now, more than ever in our history, has this verse ever been more true! 

And if you are by chance thinking, "You know, I’m really not feeding the flesh or the spirit.” Well, my friend, then you are feeding weeds. The funny thing about weeds is you don’t have to plant them. They were there before you got there. You don’t have to water them or fertilize them. If you completely ignore them, they won’t go away…it’s actually the opposite. They will grow out of control. By doing nothing, you are feeding the flesh. Don’t be a sleepy Christian. Satan loves sleepy Christians. 

Later in Deuteronomy 25:17-18 we will see how the Amalekites attacked Israel. While the children of Israel were in the wilderness, the Amalekites attacked from the back- the people who were weary and worn out. They attacked the stragglers, the ones who had lost their way, or were too weak to keep up. 

The Christians who are easy pickings for Satan are the stragglers. These are people who are not consistent in fellowship. They don’t have a discipleship program. They go to church now and again, but don’t live out their faith…oh, but they sound like they do on their Instagram pages! These are the people that are most susceptible to attacks because they are the easy ones. Don’t be an easy target. 

The battle begins and Moses, Aaron and Hur are on the hillside observing. Moses was holding his staff in his hands. Verse 11 says a strange thing occurred. As long as Moses held his staff in the air toward the heavens, the battle tilted in Israel’s favor. But when he put his arm down to rest, the battle swung toward the Amalekites. So Aaron and Hur stood on each of his sides and proper his arms so even when Moses’ arms grew tired, they didn’t rest.

Moses is in a posture of his hands raised in worship. In spiritual battles, we need spiritual weapons. The idea of having your hands raised is saying, “Lord, I trust you.” In school, you raise your hand because you know the answer. As a child you raise your hand to a loving parent to get picked up?
