?> <i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i> Read Exodus 5:22-6:2

Look back. What is the last question Moses said to the LORD in 
Exodus 5:22-23?

---

God answers Moses by letting him know that He has it all under control. 

In Exodus 6:2, what are the first two words that God says to Moses?
&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;

I am. Those two words carry a lot of weight. If God spoke to you right now, what would follow the words, _“I am”_? What is it you need to hear from Him? _I am_ : &nbsp;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;

Write God’s entire sentence in verse 2.

Using the [Blue Letter Bible](http://www.blueletterbible.org), what does the word LORD mean?
&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;

_Jehovah_ is the self-existent and eternal God. His name is _Yahweh_, _Jehovah_, `LORD`. God starts there. He is the God of the patriarchs, yet He never told them His personal name. 

Many times the Bible uses the word `lord`, `Lord`, and `LORD`. They are all different words and have different meanings. The word`lord` (all lowercase) is just an ancient term that means master. For this reason, most pagan gods were called `Lord`. 

Using [Blue Letter Bible](http://www.blueletterbible.org), find the definition of the following words: 

| Word | Strong’s | Verse | Hebrew | Definition |
| ---- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ---------- |
| lord | [H113](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h113)   | Gen 18:12      |            |
| Lord | [H136](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h136)   | Gen 18:3       |            |
| LORD | [H3068](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3068) | Gen 15:8       |            |

The word `lord`, ( _Adonai_ ) written in all lower-case letters means _“master”_, or one who has authority over another. Sarah describes her husband as `lord`. It ALWAYS refers to human masters or owners. When this word refers to `God`, then the first letter is written in upper-case. This word is used 354 times in the Bible.

`Lord` is the word for _Adonai_. This has many meanings and is often plural. The capital in front always refers to `God`, and never man. It is spoken as God’s title. The Bible often says, `Lord God` giving it a respectful title for `God`. This word is used 489 times in the Bible.
