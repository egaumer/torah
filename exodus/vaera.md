# _Va’era_ &sdot; וארא
Parashah 14 &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; _I appeared (_ 6:2&mdash;9:35 _)_

The second reading from the book of Exodus and fourteenth reading from the Torah is named _Va’era_ (וארא)<sup>[H7200](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7200/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H7200")</sup>, which means, _I appeared_. The title comes from the first words of the second verse of the reading, which says, `“And I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as God Almighty”` (Exodus 6:3). The portion begins with four promises of God to bring Israel out of the Egyptian bondage. The narrative progresses to tell the story of the first seven of the ten plagues that God unleashed on Egypt. 

While explaining to Moses the significance of His name, the LORD makes four promises of God about the rescue of the Israelites from Egypt. He says, `“I am the LORD. (1) I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and (2) I will deliver you from their bondage. (3) I will also redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments. Then (4) I will take you for My people, and I will be your God”` (Exodus 6:6–7). 

_Va'era_ teaches us important lessons about the power of God, obedience, identity, and the persistence of God's promise. These lessons can be applied to our lives and can help us grow in our faith and relationship with God

We’re going to backtrack a minute here. What is the last question Moses asked the _Lord_ in Exodus 5:22?

God answers Moses by letting him know that He has it all under control.

I am`. Those two words carry a lot of weight. If God spoke to you right now, what would follow the words, `“I am”`? What is it you need to hear from Him? I am... Write God’s entire sentence in verse 2.

Jehovah is the self-existent and eternal God. His name is Yahweh, Jehovah, LORD. God starts there. He is the God of the patriarchs, yet He never told them His personal name. Many times the Bible uses the word lord, Lord, and LORD. They are all different words and have different meanings. The word lord (all lowercase) is just an ancient term that means master. For this reason, most pagan gods were called “Lord”. Using blueletterbible.org, find the definition of the following words: 

| Word | Strong’s | Verse | Hebrew | Definition |
| ---- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ---------- |
| lord | [H113](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h113)   | Gen 18:12      |            |
| Lord | [H136](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h136)   | Gen 18:3       |            |

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>What is the meaning of the word _LORD_ in Exodus 6:2, according to blueletterbible.org?

The word `lord` (אָדוֹן)<sup>[H113](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h113/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's NumberH113")</sup>, written in all lower-case letters means _Master_, or one who has authority over another. Sarah describes her husband, Abraham, as `lord`. It ALWAYS refers to human masters or owners. This word is used _354 Times_ in the Bible.

`Lord` (אֲדֹנָי)<sup>[H136](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h136/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H136")</sup> is the Hebrew word _Adonai_. This has many meanings and is often plural. The capital in front always refers to God, and never man. It is spoken as _God’s Title_. The Bible often says, _Lord God_ giving it a respectful title for _God_. This word is used _489 Times_ in the Bible. 

_Lord_ (all capitals): This is the personal name of _God_. It is considered too sacred to be pronounced, and the exact pronunciation is uncertain. It is spelled with the Hebrew letters _Yod_ (י), _Heh_ (ה), _Waw_ (ו), _Heh_ (ה) like so _Yhwh_ (see [Tetragrammaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton)). This word is used _6,828 Times_ in the Hebrew Bible. Interesting fact: it is never used in the New Testament. 

_God_ is slowly revealing Himself to mankind throughout scripture. The difference between Lord and _Lord_ is that the first is a title, and the second is _God’s_ name. For example, my students call me Mrs. McGuire. But my friends and family call me Carol Anne. It’s a different level of intimacy. When Jesus arrived, He made the relationship between man and _God_ as personal as it gets. He became one of us, walked among us, and shared our joys and sorrows. But when Jesus left, He gave us the Holy Spirit. _God_ no longer walks among us physically, but lives within us! In the most literal sense, _God_ dwells with us internally. How awesome is that? Take a minute and just reflect on what that means to you.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 6:3-4. 

&nbsp;

Moses totally understood this. God is about to step into his world in a new way, much different and tangible than with the patriarchs. God reminds Moses that He was the Hebrew’s God in Canaan, and their God in Egypt. He heard their cry.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Study Question 3** </span><br/><br/>Look up the word _Groaning_ (נְאָקָה)<sup>[H5009](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5009/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H5009")</sup> in [blueletterbible.org](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5009/kjv/wlc/0-1/). What do you think this sounds like? How does God hear our _Groaning_ and respond to it according to the text?

&nbsp;

Ezekiel 30:24 describes that word of the sound of a wounded man. I am pretty sure there were very few words. Have you ever been in a place where your grief, hurt, worry, struggle was so severe that you could not speak, but just groan? This is what the Hebrews are feeling right now, and God heard it. He not only heard it, He is going to do something about it. 

Look up the word _Heard_ (שָׁמַע)<sup>[H8085](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8085/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H8085")</sup> in Exodus 6:5. What does it mean?

I’m so glad _God_ doesn’t _Hear_" our groaning like we watch people suffering on the evening news. Yes, there are probably stories that touch your heart, but in the next breath you may be rummaging through the kitchen looking for a snack, or playing a video game on your phone. When I’m groaning before the _Lord_, I don’t need Him to only audibly hear me, I need Him to comfort me, to run to me, and that is what He is doing to the Hebrews. 

By the way, this is also the kind of “hearing” _God_ wants us to do. He is not interested in if the audible sound waves hit our ears perfectly. He is interested in action. Oh that we would respond to _Yhwh_ with the same speed that we want Him to respond to us. Stop. Read that sentence again. Now one more time

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Study Question 4** </span><br/><br/>In Exodus 6:6-8, what is it that God is promising them? (List all the _I Will_ statements.)

&nbsp;

God answers their cry with a message full of love and hope. Throughout the rest of the Bible, the Exodus of Egypt is going to represent servitude and a foreign place- it’s a way of life that was not meant for _God’s_ people. Egypt is the place we cried and groaned, before _God_ came to rescue us. Jesus made it possible for Gentiles to be joined into this beautiful covenant with Israel. The list of “I wills” you wrote are promises for anyone that trusts in _God’s_ provision. 

Are you finding yourself in a foreign place? Are you in a place of bondage that you can’t struggle out of? God will redeem you. He will take you as His people. He will be your God. He will bring you out of that place and into the light. Every single promise of a new life that we receive through Jesus Christ originated right here in the Torah. 

Finish verse 9: `"Moses reported this to the Israelites, but ____"`.

Did your heart just sink? There is hope right at their doorstep, within reach! It’s just a breath away, but they were so physically exhausted from their work, they could not accept it. 

My heart hurts for them. And for our world right now. We burn candles at both ends, are in a flurry of activities and commitments. Go ahead, name 5 things right now that take up your time and make you feel exhausted.

I bet that list could have gone well beyond 5 things. Jannita always says, “Busy is not a badge of honor.” This is why _God_ demands a Sabbath for us. He knew that we would not take time out to rest. We cannot live our lives constantly out of breath due to the high demands and things that pull us in different directions. When we live that way, we are not only defined by our busyness, but our bitterness in our souls. 

The Hebrews were in servitude to Egypt. We are slaves to our culture, jobs, and schedules (that we create and are created for us). We are even experts at making schedules that take our time. _God_ wanted to rescue Israel, just like he wants to rescue us. The Hebrews just couldn’t listen and accept His offer because they were so discouraged and overworked. And you know what, discouragement is contagious. It sure is. Moses has just been given a beautiful covenant from the _God_ who created the heavens and the earth. It was a covenant of love and hope. _God_ wants to rescue His people. That is exciting. And I’m sure Moses ran to the Israelites with excitement and joy when he told them what God was going to do.

But their discouragement put a damper on Moses. _God_ tells Moses in verse 11, `“Go tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country”`. Moses should have skipped over to deliver this message. But what is his response to _God_ in verse 12?

Maybe that’s why we tell people to bow their heads and close their eyes at an altar call. We don’t need to focus on other people when _God_ is calling us. At that moment, it’s not about them, it’s about you. How will you respond when God calls YOU? After you have groaned before the _Lord_, and have heard Him call you. Will you listen to the problem or the promise? 

I understand how pastors, teachers, and parents feel this discouragement. For those of you in ministry, here’s a word for you. If _God_ gave you a word to tell the people, tell it. It’s _God’s_ job to change their hearts. You cannot accept deliverance for anyone. You can’t even save your own children. You can only be obedient to the call _God_ has given you. There will be times when the very people you are sent to help will turn away. Until _God_ releases you from that call, give 100% of yourself to the work of _God_. 

For those of you who do not have a formal ministry, you’re not out of the woods. God has called you to speak the message of salvation to the unsaved. It’s _God’s_ job to prepare their hearts. Our words will fail because our words were never the key anyway. A perfectly worded plea will not bring anyone into salvation. The moving of hearts always belongs to _God_. It always has been _God_. It always will be _God_. 

I can tell you one thing for certain, whether you are a pastor or a lay person, you are completely inadequate for the task that _God_ has given to you- including spreading the gospel. If I had you make a list on all the reasons why you are NOT able to teach a Sunday school class, or invite someone to church, or share your faith with a neighbor, you could will up 4-5 pages of excuses. And you would be right about most of those reasons. Being a follower of Christ was never promised to be easy. 

Yep, probably not how you wanted to end this day’s lesson, but it’s the truth. There is nothing we can do but to trust and obey _God_. If He says, _Go_. we go; He’ll do the rest. Moses is about to learn this lesson as well.

# Day 2 &middot; _The Showdown Begins_

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 7:1-13

I cannot believe I get to write this chapter during this week of the year. In just a few days will be Passover. This is the beginning of that story! This is story of redemption, a celebration of deliverance, a reminder of what it means to be truly free. It’s a story of the power of faith and perseverance; family and community. It serves as a powerful symbol of hope and what _God_ can do with your life when you surrender fully to Him. 

We’re going to learn the cost of redemption in this book. I think, as Christians, we’ve cleaned up this word and polished it so much, that we don’t see the pain and anguish in this term. Redemption is messy. To be redeemed should bring us to our knees in gratitude and humbleness. Redemption is a life for a life. 

As we dive into Exodus, pay close attention to how Moses behaves and what he does, and what the Lord expects of Him: because it is a _Shadow of the Messiah_.

_God_ is about to act in such a powerful way that the Jewish people will focus on this series of events every year throughout the rest of history as we know it. The Jewish calendar will revolve around the redemption out of Egypt. This is the beginning of Israel’s life-changing story that will be told from generation to generation.

Chapter 7 is the beginning of the biggest showdown in the Old Testament. It is between _Yhwh_, the God of the universe, and Pharaoh - who thought he was a god. The first time Moses went before Pharaoh, Pharaoh asked, `“Who is the Lord that I should obey Him?”` Remember that? Well, Pharaoh is about to find out. _God_ is about to introduce Himself in a powerful, dramatic way that Pharaoh and the Egyptians will not soon forget.

The gods and goddesses of Egypt all had a physical, tangible manifestation in the form of idols and elements of nature that were worshipped. The Egyptians actually considered Pharaoh to be a god- he was a physical manifestation of that god.

```
Then the LORD said to Moses, “See, I have made you like ____ to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your ____. “ - (NIV Exodus 7:1)
```

Pharaoh could not relate to an unseen god. All of the Egyptian gods were statues of stone or metal, gold, wood, etc. Everything was a god. It was a polytheistic worship system. Even the Nile and the sun were gods. So the signs that _God_ is going to perform through Moses will also be very visible, very tangible. It’s going to affect the life of every Egyptian. Moses is going to show them who the one true God is.

Do you see the pattern? _God_ puts Moses in the road of the divine god, a mediator, and his brother Aaron as a prophet or spokesman. He then puts Jesus, _Yeshua_, in the role of _Divine God_ and _Mediator_, and _John the Baptist_ as a prophet or spokesman to pave the way for Jesus.

This was all perfectly understandable to Pharaoh. After all, he was considered _Divine_ and Moses is a divine negotiator. But there is a difference. Pharaoh is delusional, Moses was sent by the power of _God_. It’s hardly a fair match. 

We are in the same role as Moses. To the world, you represent _God_. If they don’t like something about _God_ or something they hear about _God_ or the Bible, they will often get mad at you. They’ll take it out on you. Really, when you think about it, it’s kind of a compliment. We are the royal representation of the One True God. We represent the King of heaven, the God of the universe. And it’s important that we represent Him in a very clear and unmistakable and holy fashion.

```
“But I will ____ Pharaoh’s heart.” - (NIV Exodus 7:3 )
```

What’s up with that? Why would _God_ say that? Why would He say, “Ok, go do what I am asking you to do, but I’m going to be hardening his heart.” 

Pharaoh is making his own choice. _God_ is going to come along and fortify the choice that he makes. _God_ is saying, “OK Pharaoh, make a choice. Whatever choice you make- whether it is evil or good, I’m going to _Harden_ / _Strengthen_ the resolve that you have.” 

This week I got to go see the theatrical production of Moses with Eric, Shannon , Zoe and Jen. Wow. When we got home we were comparing notes and talking about our favorite parts. One of the moments stuck with me. It was at this moment in the production, when Pharaoh’s heart was hardened that it was said: “The same sun that melts wax is the same sun that hardens clay.” It’s really up to us on how we respond to God. Is our heart soft and pliable when it comes to the things of _God_? Or are we already hardening our hearts to His work in our lives? Only you can really answer that question. But one fact remains: the sun is coming. Or should I say, The _Son_ is coming. How will your heart respond? Let the Son light in. Let it change you and mold you.

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 2 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>What reasons can you see for Pharaoh to NOT let the Hebrews go?

&nbsp;

The Egyptian population at that time was approximately 10-12 million people. The Hebrews numbered between 2.5-3 million. By letting them go, Egypt stood to lose 25% of their population and almost the entire work force. It would be crippling. 

Let’s put that in our terms. As of our latest census (2021) the US has a population of 331.9 million people. If we were to suddenly lose 82 million people, and these people were our construction workers, electricians, plumbers, cargo ship operators, truck drivers, artisans, etc. what would happen? Our entire economy would collapse. This isn’t a power outage that will be up and running in 24 hours. This is devastating!

Imagine. What would happen to our banking system? Political power? This is what Pharaoh is facing. Egypt is a superpower. Of course he is saying, “no.” You can see why, right? But what we are going to see is that Egypt is going to be crippled long before the devastation of their workforce leaving. Egypt is going to go through 10 catastrophic plagues… BEFORE their infrastructure collapses. This is a disaster that they still have not recovered from. 

How old is Moses in Exodus 7:7? He is JUST starting his ministry now. (Yep, mind blown.) His brother, Aaron, is 83! Some people are afraid of old age. This is _God’s_ beginning chapter of their lives. For most people, this is when you start slowing down and letting the youngsters pick up the heavy lifting. There are some people who are afraid of getting old. What if we can’t do what we used to do? What if no one cares about our abilities and only focuses on our grey hair and wrinkles? _God’s_ got bigger plans. And the same _God_ who watches over us is the same _God_ is going to give them the strength they need to make it through. 

And just in case you’re on the other side of aged wisdom, God can use you, too! Paul told Timothy, `“Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example to the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity.” (NIV 1 Timothy 4:12 NIV)`

_God_ is about to demonstrate His ultimate power over the entire godless system in Egypt. Beginning in verse 14, what is the first plague?

There are 10 plagues… actually, there are 9 plagues, and one judgement. Using the blueletterbible.org, what does the word _Plague_ (נֶגַע)<sup>[H5061](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5061/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H5061")</sup> mean?

_Nega_ is a generic word that could mean a lot of things: _Plague_, _Sore_, _Stroke_, _Mark_, _Sickness_, _Earthquake_, etc. 

The first of these 9 plagues were to convince Pharaoh to AVOID the judgement and final plague that _Yhwh_ said would happen if the king did not release Israel. They were in 3 sets of 3, and all progressive.

In the first set of three, the entire land of Egypt and everyone in it (Egyptians, Hebrews, tourists…) all people were affected. All of these 3 plagues affected the luxury of Egypt. These were the most mild. It’s the precursor. 

The second set of plagues touched the lifestyle of Egypt and happened only to the Egyptians. This affected all of the possessions that they owned: cattle, life stock, and their own bodies. In this way, _God_ divided and separated His people (another _God_ pattern that you will see throughout the Scripture).

_God_ used the last third of the series of plagues to show Pharaoh the Yahweh was the author of all things- not His mediator, or his prophet. And that God, Yahweh, the God of Israel, was supreme over all things, everywhere, including the powerful Egypt. This set of plagues touched life itself, ending with the death of the firstborn. 

This is a pattern you will see many, many times in Scripture. _God_ is making a distinction between His people and all others. Pharaoh had the inside scoop because Moses and Aaron were letting him know what was happening. But the only way the people of Egypt are going to understand this separation is to experience it. (And soon, God will do this again. Like Pharaoh, the world will literally experience the division and separation of _God’s_ people.) 

Imagine for a moment (pre-social media) how fast news would travel that these events were only happening to the Egyptians. The slaves, the Hebrews, were not affected at all. This was supernatural. 

Now all of these plagues are occurrences that would happen in nature- but that’s where these events take a split from the natural world: 

1. They came at Moses’ command. 
2. They came at an abnormal time of year. 
3. They were must more drastic than in nature, and they happened one after another. 

There was no doubt that what they were experiencing was the supernatural. 

In verses 10-13, what miracle did Moses and Aaron do when they went to see Pharaoh? 

What’s the big deal about a snake? Pharaoh literally wore a serpent on his regal headdress. In Egyptian culture, the serpent symbolized both royal power and healing and was worn on the regal headdress. This act was an affront to Pharaoh's sovereignty. The sorcerers, under Satan's influence, attempted to replicate the miracle by turning their staffs into snakes. However, _God's_ power proved to be stronger than that of the magicians, and Moses' staff swallowed up their serpents.Despite this display of divine power, Pharaoh remained defiant and refused to acknowledge it

# Day 3 &middot; _There's Power in the Blood_

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 7:14-24

Based on the development of certain crops that were affected by the plagues, we can estimate that the entire process from the first plague (blood in the Nile) to the last (death of the firstborns) was approximately 10 months time - beginning in May/June and ending the following March/April. These plagues played out in an extended period, so Pharaoh had plenty of time to consider and reconsider what was happening. Their response should have been repentance and obedience. Instead, when the plagues eased up and a sense of normalcy came, they chose to harden their hearts. It’s interesting to see how when things start to ease up we forget what God has told us. 

After one plague started ebbing away, I’m sure Pharaoh thought that he beat it. He was a god! He did not have to bow to this unknown and unseen God. Is there a better picture of human nature? 

I remember that after 911 our churches overflowed. People saved their money and took care of their neighbors. Christians actually wondered if God was displeased with us, and was pulling off His hand of protection. But that didn’t last long. We eased into a “new normal.” People haven’t changed much in 3500 years…

In the battle between Moses and Pharaoh, Moses receives instructions from _God_ to meet Pharaoh at the Nile. Pharaoh would go down to the river in the summer months and offer praise to the god of the Nile River. There were several gods that are associated with the river: Hapi, Isis, Osiris and Khnum are just a few. The Egyptians often referred to the Nile as the “bloodstream of the god Osiris.” I don’t think it was a coincidence that the bloodstream turned to blood. (By the way, Egyptians hated blood- that’s why they never participated in blood sacrifices. 

![hapi](https://www.youregypttours.com/images/hapi-egyptian-god.jpg)

Moses warns Pharaoh of the first plague, and then turns the Nile and all its water sources into blood. The miracle affected everyone in Egypt, including the Hebrews who relied on the Nile for water. All water, even water that was not in the Nile, but came from the Nile was now blood: in cooking pots, drinking containers, water storage… everywhere. The fish died and the river stunk. Perhaps _God_ is saying, “Pharaoh, your religion stinks. And all your gods cannot quench your thirst. They can’t even satisfy your basic needs.

Contrast this to Jesus who said to the woman at the well of Samaria, `“If you drink this water you’ll get thirsty again. But whoever drinks at the water that I shall give, will never thirst”`. 

Pharaoh’s magicians were able to counterfeit this…but wouldn’t it have been better if they actually reversed the plague? Of course. But they couldn’t. Seriously. If there is no water to drink, how smart is it to replicate this and ruin whatever you actually have? Can you imagine a superpower country that has no water to give to its people for a week? _God_ is getting their attention. 

I want to draw your attention to a passage found in Revelation 16:4, `“And the third angel poured out his bowl on the ____ and the springs of ____ and they became ____.”` 

What happened in Egypt is going to happen again- but in a much greater form as _YHWH_, the God of Israel gets the attention of the entire world. And like He judged the gods of the past, He will judge the false belief system and the humanism of our modern time with the Great Tribulation Period. 

Pharaoh is going to discover that it’s really stupid to fight _God_. You can try. But you’re not going to win. Some of us are fighting God right now. It’s ok. Just know it’s a losing battle because you are going to have to stand before a Holy _God_ and give an account of your life. PLEASE. Do not mistake _God’s_ long-suffering for _God’s_ approval. _God_ is patiently reaching out 
to you. Respond. 

_God_ took the bloodstream of Osiris, the Nile River, and turned it to blood, showing the Egyptians that the earth is the _Lord's_ and the fullness thereof. There IS a sovereign God in heaven. The blood was a sign that _God_ means business. He is going to deliver His people. To the Egyptians it was a sign of judgement. To the Israelites, it was a sign of salvation. 

_God_ put His one and only Son on a cross so that through His shedding of blood we could be saved. WE can be delivered. That same blood is a symbol of judgement to the world, but a symbol of salvation to us.

I want to end today with a story. Sit back and relax friends, it’s story time with your neighborhood librarian! Legacy of the Blood You're driving home on a Friday after a long day at work and turn on the radio. The newscaster is talking about a small village in China where some villagers have died suddenly of a flu that has never been heard of before and three people have died. There is a cohort of doctors going over to investigate. You really don’t think much about it.

But on Sunday, on your way to church, you hear another story about that village… and it’s no longer 3 people, it's 30,000. CNN now has the story and is saying that the Centers for Disease Control is heading there to investigate. Panic begins to set in as you realize that this mystery flu could become a global pandemic.

By Monday morning, it's the lead story on all news channels. And it’s not just in China. It's in Italy and Pakistan and India. The disease has been coined the “mystery flu.” The President makes a public announcement that he and the White House staff are praying for the people suffering from this Mystery Flu. But shortly after that, he announces that the flu has hit Mexico and is close to our border. He’s closing the borders. Flights are canceled to the infested countries.

The family huddles around the TV as you listen to the reports come in. There are no signs of anything for the first week. Most people don’t even know they are transmitting the flu. It's followed by days of fever and difficulty breathing, then death. The world is in a state of chaos, and you begin to fear for the safety of your family and loved ones.

On Tuesday, the President announces that all flights to and from Europe and Asia have been canceled. If your loved ones are overseas, they cannot come back until there is a cure for the disease. On Wednesday night at Bible study, someone runs into the church yelling, “Turn on the news! Turn on the news!” The mystery flu has hit the US and people are dead in Massachusetts, New York, and California. The CDC is working around the clock to find an antidote, but nothing is working. Mass mask mandates go into effect for the public’s safety.

Finally, news of a vaccine appears! The code has been broken. There is a catch though. It will require the blood of somebody who has not yet been infected. All news stations are broadcasting that people need to quickly make their way to their local hospital to have their blood checked. Hospitals will provide further instructions.

When you and your family get to the hospital on Friday evening, there is a long line. Doctors and nurses are busy pricking fingers, taking blood, labeling and categorizing everything. They check your blood, your wife, and your kids. Then you are told to wait in the parking lot with the others. There is a sea of people just waiting. The tension is palpable.

Until suddenly, a woman comes out of the hospital yelling a name and carrying a clipboard. She yells it again. Your son tugs on your jacket and says, “Daddy, that’s me.” Your heart sinks as you realize what this means. They quickly take your boy inside, and you can barely contain your fear and anxiety. “Hold up.” You absolutely insist on following them into the hospital.

The doctor informs you, “We think he’s got the right blood type. His blood is clean. His blood is pure.” Five minutes later, the doctors and nurses are surrounding you, crying and hugging one another. Some are even laughing. It’s the first time you’ve seen anyone laugh in a week. One of the doctors shakes your hand and says, “Thank you, sir. Your son’s blood type is perfect. It’s clean. It’s pure. We can make the vaccine.”

As the doctor pulls you and your wife aside, your heart begins to race. You can sense that something is not right. Word has quickly spread across the parking lot and people are weeping for joy, praying and laughing. But something in the air has shifted, and it's as if a dark cloud has descended upon you.

The grey-haired doctor hands you a consent form, and you begin to sign it. But as you look closer, you notice that the space for the amount of pints to be taken is empty. Your stomach churns as you ask, "How many pints are you asking for?"

The doctor's face grows somber as he quietly says, "We had no idea that he would be a child. We were not prepared. We need it all. We're talking about the world here. We really need it all."

You feel your heart drop into your stomach as you plead with the doctor, "Can't you give him a transfusion?"

"I'm sorry. We need clean blood. Please, will you sign?" the doctor responds.

You sign the paper in numb silence. The doctor gently asks, "Would you like to have a moment with him before we begin?" You walk back to the room where your son sits on the table.

"Daddy? Mommy? What is happening?" he asks, confusion and fear in his eyes.

You take his hand and tell him, "Son, we love you so much. And we would never let anything happen to you that didn't have to be. Do you understand that?"

The doctor returns and says, "I'm sorry. We've got to get started. People all over the world are dying." As you leave, you hear your son cry out, "Dad! Dad! Why are you leaving me?"

The next week, during the funeral service to honor your son, you feel a deep sense of grief and anger. Some people come with a pretentious smile, and you can see that they're only pretending to care. Others don't come at all because they've gone to the beach. As you sit there, listening to the eulogies, you want to jump up and scream, "My son died. Don't youcare?"

The parable is clear. 

Our Heavenly Father gave his only Son. The blood of His Son was the vaccine for the sin of the world. Do you care? 

We care. And we want to pass this legacy to our children.

# Day 4 &middot; _One More Night With the Frogs, Please_

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 8.

As I write this, my daughter Katy is 4 months pregnant. She is due in September 2023.

Exodus is the story of the birth of a nation. Birth is exciting…but it’s always messy and painful. Every mother has a story (or two).

The word _Exodus_ means _Outgoing_ or _Exit_. The people of Israel are going to exit the land of Egypt. They went into Egypt as a family, and they are leaving as a nation of over two million people. 

The themes of this book are _Redemption_, _Salvation_, _Deliverance_ and _Revelation_. _God_ redeems His people. He saves His people, delivers them, and then He reveals Himself. That’s pretty much our story, too! _God_ has redeemed you, saved you, delivered you, and then He reveals Himself to you

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>We all have a story. Do you remember the day you met God?

Let’s review a little. The first plague was ______. And that is significant because ______. 

The Nile was the primary source of water. It was actually considered a god to be worship. The first plague was a judgment upon the worship system of the false god of the Nile River. 

All of these plagues are answering Pharaoh’s question, “Who is the Lord? Who is Yahweh that I should obey Him?” So _God_ is going to graciously answer his question. He is going to introduce Himself to Pharaoh through a series of unmistakable attention-getting events. 

<i style='font-size: 1.25em' class="fa-solid fa-skull"></i> &nbsp; _Plague_ **<i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-2"></i>** (Exodus 8:5) &bull; _The Plague of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;_

In Egypt, one of the most beautiful temples for worship was for the ugliest goddess: the frog-goddess, _Heqet_ (pronounced Heket.) Heqet had the body of a woman and the head of a frog. 

She is the goddess of fertility and resurrection. When babies were born, she was thought to help the Egyptian women in child birth. Does this remind you of when Moses was found by Pharaoh’s daughter many years before? She called him _Moses_, or _Moshe_, which means _Drawn out of the Water_. Perhaps she was praying for Heqet to help her have a child, and “Heqet” delivered this child to her miraculously. 

It was a great offense to kill a frog in Egypt. There were certain animals that were sacred- like cows are in India. It was a capital offense to kill a 
frog, punishable by death. Frogs were worshipped because they reproduces quickly, and being amphibians- they were a part of two world (both land and water). The Egyptians were also very superstitious. If you saw a frog while you were walking, it was a good omen. To actually have a frog was something good. (Can you have too much of a good thing?) 

So plague #2 is attacking that part of the worship system to this goddess. Since the Egyptians worshipped the frog, _God_ gave them a plague of frogs. We see both God’s determined plan and His sense of humor. Aaron stretches out his hands over the waters of Egypt and frogs came up and covered the land.

Plagues one and two are related. Do you remember the picture of Hapi from last week? Hapi in many hieroglyphics is depicted as holding a frog. The god of frogs, Heqet, provides nourishment from the Nile. 

This plague is going to make frogs a nuisance. They will not be providing nourishment. Come on, imagine it. You’re coming home from work in your chariot and there are frogs all over the street. You walk in your front door to frogs. There are frogs in your frig. Frogs in your closet, frogs in your bed. In your bed?! Yep! Cozy on up to a slimy slippery frog. GROSS! 

But again, the magicians replicate this with magic. This is not the work of a skilled illusionist, this was occult power at work. Isn’t it interesting that when the entire country is being overrun by frogs, the magicians make even more frogs, making the problem even worse? How about doing some magic to get rid of them? For real! They cannot take away what _God_ put there. They can only counterfeit it. Interesting. A counterfeit doesn’t disprove the real thing. It actually proves that something genuine exists. It only authenticates that there is a real, original one. They cannot eradicate it, they can only 
duplicate it. If they could have, they would have!

Check out Pharaoh’s tactics so far. He uses violence and persecution: he tried to kill all of the male children of Israel, but that didn’t work. So he tried to oppress the adults and make them slaves. That didn’t work because they kept growing as a people. So if persecution doesn’t work, let’s try imitation. Maybe we can confuse them. 

In Acts, the early church experienced the same thing. There was a frontal attack, a persecution, but the church kept growing. In Acts 8 a man wanted to pay money to receive the Holy Spirit so he could work miracles like Peter and John. He wanted to imitate the real thing. 

Pharaoh summons Moses and Aaron in verse 8 and asks them to pray to the LORD to take away the frogs. Moses said to Pharaoh (vs 9): `“I leave to you the ____ of setting the time for me to pray for you”`. 

You would think Pharaoh would respond, “NOW! Immediately! Pray this instant! Get these gross, slimy creatures out of here.” But that’s not what he said. When does he want it done (vs 10)? WHAT? That’s a weird answer, right? I guess having frogs for pillows was not that big of an inconvenience for Pharaoh- he wants one more night with the frogs. 

Sin is just like that. When you you want to get rid of this mess? When do you want to leave this all behind and get cleaned up? Tomorrow. I just want one more night with the frogs, please. I can stop my addiction any time…in fact, I’m goin to stop tomorrow. Then they wake up and their whole life is filled with frogs.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>How does Pharaoh’s answer resemble our own resistance to God’s grace and mercy? 

&nbsp;

What is there in your life that God is saying, “Get rid of it now. Deal with it now. Leave it behind today… tomorrow might be too late.”

I’ve had a dead mouse in my house, and the smell was horrible. But can you imagine piles and piles of dead frogs in your house? The stink had to be horrific. There were piles and piles of their dead goddesses everywhere. 

And the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart. Isn’t that just like human nature? How many times do we promise, “Oh God, please give me this and I promise I’ll do this for you.” Then relief comes, and you say, “What? Did I say that?” No doubt the pattern of hardening his heart because easier and easier for Pharaoh.

<i style='font-size: 1.25em' class="fa-solid fa-skull"></i> &nbsp; _Plague_ **<i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-3"></i>** (Exodus 8:16-19) &bull; _The Plague of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;_

One of the gods the Egyptians worshiped was the earth god, Geb (or Seb). Geb reported the state of the earth and the harvest to Osiris (god of the afterlife) on a regular basis. This plague came unannounced. This time _God_ did not show Pharaoh the mercy of a warning and in invitation to repentance. We must never think _God_ is unfair when He does not show mercy. If someone were totally fair, they would never show mercy. 

This plague struck at the heart of all Egyptian worship, especially at their priests. The Egyptian priesthood was extremely careful about hygiene and ritual cleaning. An infestation of lice made them unable to worship their gods.

Aaron stretched out his hand and the dust of the earth became gnats. Think of thousands of lice crawling up your legs… I’m getting itchy just writing this. These little gnats were considered to be pollutants to any Egyptian temple. They were hardly visible to the human eye, but stung and created a horrible skin irritation. When we walk around our reservoir, we sometimes see these little gnats swarming. They get in your nose and eyes. But imagine them in your neck, on your legs, in your nostrils and ears… YUCK! And you know you look like a crazy person when you are trying to swat them away because they are so small! Ha! I’m laughing just thinking about us swatting at the swarms! 

Interestingly enough, the magicians could not reproduce the gnats. Satan’s power is limited. They will not be able to replicate any further plagues. Their response to Pharaoh in verse 19 was, `“This is the _______ of _______”`.

blueletterbible.org - What is the word for “God” in verse 19? _______

It is the finger of _Elohim_ not the finger of _Yhwh_. They’re not being specific. Moses is saying “The _Lord_ _Yhwh_ has sent us.” But the magicians were saying “this is the finger of _Elohim_, in plural, the gods.” That is what they’re acknowledging. They know it is a supernatural source, but they are not acknowledging _Yhwh_… yet.

<i style='font-size: 1.25em' class="fa-solid fa-skull"></i> &nbsp; _Plague_ **<i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-4"></i>** (Exodus 8:20-32) &bull; _The Plague of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;_

Verse 20: Then the _Lord_ said to Moses, `“Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the river and say to him, ‘This is what the Lord says: ___________, so that they may worship me’”`.

Moses’ message has not changed. But this time there’s a little caveat attached to the command. “Let My people go…or else.” Or else what? 

```
“If you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of ____ on ____ and ____ officials, on ____ people and into ____ houses. The houses of the ____ will be full of flies; even the ground will be covered with them.” - (Exodus 8:21 NIV)
```

God is now making a separation between the Egyptians and the Israelites. No more plagues will come upon the Israelites. This plague moves to a different level, adding destruction as well as discomfort to the consequences of their decisions. 

The Egyptians regarded the fly as the manifestation of a god called Uatchit (or sometimes known as Khepri). This fly was not a common housefly, but a scarab beetle. (Ever heard of one of those? They are the symbol of Egypt! It’s all over their tombs. It’s all over their hieroglyphics. The ancient Egyptians believed that scarab beetles were born from nothing and were the symbol of renewal, transformation, rebirth and eternal life (which is why kings were buried with them). This god had the head of a scarab beetle. 

Verse 23: `“I will make a _________ between my people and your people”`. God is promising to make a difference in judgment. In the future, the world will experience what happened to Egypt again, but next time it will be much worse. (You can read about it in the book of Revelation 16-19.) Plague after plague, judgment is coming to the earth. Millions upon millions of people will be killed in those judgments. But here’s something you need to know about your God. Your God knows how to make a distinction when it comes to judgment. 

John 16:33 says, `“In this world you will have ______________. But take heart! I have overcome the world”`. We will all have hard times and good times, diseases and health, sun and rain. This trouble / tribulation is from a fallen world. The god of this world is satan. 

But here’s the best part, when it comes to judgment from the _Lord_, something is different. _God_ makes a difference.

In Genesis 6-9 we hear the story of Noah. _God_ made a way for Noah and his family. Our God knows how to rescue the godly people from their trials even while punishing the wicked. He did it in the past, and He will do it in the future. This is a _God Pattern_. 

And the flies came. `“Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh’s palace and into the houses of his officials; throughout Egypt the land was ruined by the flies.”` (Vs 24) These flies would make it impossible for the Egyptian gods to be worshipped because of the uncleanness. Verse 25: `“Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, ‘Go, sacrifice to your God _____________ in the land’”`.

_God_ has Pharaoh’s attention now. He is going to compromise by letting Moses and Aaron sacrifice to _God_… but notice the qualifier “here in the land”. He is not letting them leave. This is the very first time when Pharaoh is giving permission for them to go and sacrifice. But he is making a compromise. Satan is a great compromiser. “Go ahead and go to church if you must… just don’t become one of those Christians. Don’t get sold out.” Or “Be a Christian, but keep your old habits. It’s ok.” He wants you to compromise. Evil is always suggesting some compromise. To listen to it , is to remain enslaved. 

<i class="fa-solid fa-book-open-reader"></i> &nbsp;_Story Time_! 

> A hunter was coming up on a bear. He had him in his sites. Just before he shot the bear, the bear turned around and said, “Hey. What are you doing?”<br/><br/>
The hunter replied, “I’m going to shoot you.” <br/><br/>
The bear said, “Wait a minute. Put that gun down. Let’s talk about it. I think we can come up with a good compromise. What is it that you want?” <br/><br/>
The hunter thought about it and said, “I’d like a fur coat.” <br/><br/>
The bear said, “OK, that’s a start. All I want is a good meal. Let’s compromise.” <br/><br/>
They walked into the forest together arm-in-arm. The gun was put down and they talked and talked and negotiated a deal. A few minutes later, the bear came out licking his chops and patting his belly. They both got what they wanted. The hunter got a fur coat and the bear got a good meal! <br/><br/>

That’s what compromise will do.

“Go and sacrifice, but stay in the land.” That may have been a good deal. I wonder if Moses was tempted? That sounds like a good deal, right? Nope. Moses said (_Verse 26_), `“That would not be right”`. The Israelites knew that blood sacrifice was not acceptable to the Egyptians because they worshipped those animals.

# Day 5 &middot; _Children of Israel_

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 9. 

The people of Egypt were very superstitions. They had a vast amount of gods, so many that it is difficult to determine an exact number. Some estimates suggest that there were over 2,000 different gods and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt. The Pharaoh, himself, was considered deity as well. Rememberthe conversation when he asked, `“Who is the Lord that I should obey him?”` (Exodus 5:2). And as we’ve been discovering, _God_ is happy to introduce Himself. Pharaoh is not only going to know who _Yhwh_ is, but that He is greater by far than any of his gods or goddesses. 

Can you just imagine Moses acting like a little kid with Pharaoh and saying, “My God’s better than your god! Nee-ner-nee-ner!” God is not only getting Pharaoh’s attention in a dynamic way, but he is being very gracious to him, allowing him the opportunity to turn and repent…but he doesn’t turn.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>Has God ever had to get your attention in a dramatic way? 

&nbsp;

Sometimes He does. It really depends on the person. Some people don’t need much discipline to get back in line. You just give them a little nudge and they get the message. Others have to be more persuaded. Here’s the thing about God. He’s not intimidated by either type of person. He is happy to gently nudge us. But if we don’t want to listen, _God_ has very creative ways of getting your attention. 

<i style='font-size: 1.25em' class="fa-solid fa-skull"></i> &nbsp; _Plague_ **<i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-5"></i>** (Exodus 9:3) &bull; _The Plague of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;_

This is the fifth time Moses has told Pharaoh, `“Let my people go, so that they may ____ me”` (9:1). In this appeal two things are clear: 

1. The people of Israel belong to _God_, not Pharaoh. 
2. God wanted Pharaoh to let the children of Israel go for the sake of the _Lord_ Himself, not so much for the sake of the Israelites. This is a really important point because God does not want us to have freedom for the sake of being free. Freedom is for the purpose of worshiping and serving the Lord. Moses didn’t say, “Let them go because they have rights.” Rights are important, don’t get me wrong. But  freedom, is given first and foremost to worship and serve the Lord. 

Look back at Exodus 8 for a minute. The Egyptian priests said something after one of the plagues in (8:19), `“This is the ____ of God”`. 

Moses is now saying in 9:2-3, `“If you refuse to let them go to worship me, the ____ of the LORD will bring a terrible plague on your livestock.”` 

Guess what friends? If plague 4 was a finger, you’re about to see _God’s_ hand. It is at this point that the plagues become much more intense and much more severe until the final plague of death of the firstborn. As I’m writing this, I want to shout at Pharaoh, “Don’t harden your heart! You’re not only going to lose 25% of your population and all of your construction workers, but your country is going to have turmoil such as they have never seen before!” 

All of the plagues before have been annoying, maddening, inconvenient…but now…now God is going to touch their wealth. Their livestock is going to die. Verse 4: `“But the LORD will make a ____ between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that ____ animal belonging to the ____ will die.”` 

What did Pharaoh do after all of the livestock of the Egyptians died? Verse 7: He `“____”`. He did a little research and found that what Moses said was true. But he became hard again and would not let the people go. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>What do you think Pharaoh thought when he investigated and it was exactly like Moses had said?

&nbsp;

In the Nile delta the Egyptians worshipped the god of Apis, the bull god. Apis was considered a sacred animal. There is a second goddess, a cow 
goddess named Hathor. She is the goddess of love and fertility, beauty and joy. She has the body of a woman and the head of a cow. 

Fun history fact: Cole cites an ancient record of a battle the Egyptians lost because their enemies put a herd of cattle in front of their advancing troops. It worked because the Egyptian solders would not shoot at an opposing army for fear of accidentally killing what they considered to be the sacred cattle! 

Here’s something to think about. This won’t happen until later in Exodus 32, but when Moses goes up to the mountain to hear from _God_, the people gather around and think, “Moses must be dead. We need a god to worship.” And what is the depiction that they built?

In their minds, they cannot fathom an unseen god. They needed a visual representation just like all the other pagans around them. The golden calf was representative of strength and beauty…but it was also a false god. 

All the cows are dead. No more burgers or steaks. You could say _God_ had a real “beef” with the gods of Egypt! Holy cow, right?!

&nbsp;

A soft heart fears the Lord. A soft heart obeys God’s word. Pharaoh did not fear God. 

<i style='font-size: 1.25em' class="fa-solid fa-skull"></i> &nbsp; _Plague_ **<i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-6"></i>** (Exodus 9:8-12) &bull; _The Plague of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;_

We are going to see _God_ establish patterns. We’ve seen it since Genesis 1. _God_ is a _God_ of order, not of chaos. We can look at history and see the _God_ never changes. These patterns should give us confidence. When we read in the Torah of the patterns that God has established, then we can see in the NT that they are brought to a fuller meaning by Jesus. 

What does _God_ tell Moses and Aaron to do in _Verse 8_?

There is no warning with this plague. No 24 hour notice. It just comes. This is going to be an airborne plague. Ancient researches noted that in the summertime there is a phenomenon called _Nile Blisters_. In the intense heat in Egypt (120-130 degrees F), with the dust that hovers in the air, Nile blisters can appear. They clustered into ulcerations on the entire body. _God_ is using a natural phenomenon with heightened supernatural factors. 

Another interesting thing is that the sky goddess, Nut (or Neit) brought blessings on the earth when the priests of Egypt would take soot and dust and throw it into the air. The Egyptian god Imhotep was said to be the god of medicine. Even those who were thought to be the closest to the Egyptian god (the court magicians) were stricken with this plague. That which was a blessing is now a curse. 

Moses and Aaron took handfuls of furnace soot and threw it toward heaven. This furnace was most likely one of the brick ovens where the slaves baked bricks for the buildings of Pharaoh. _God_ turns the tables completely on them. In verse 11, `“The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils”`. The boils were on the magicians and all of the Egyptians. The Egyptian gods Nut and Imhotep could no longer 
protect them.

The Egyptians were strictly forbidden from serving in any way if they had any kind of blister on their skin. Remember when covid closed down every store due to transmission. The Egyptian economy was completely incapacitated. No one can go out of their homes and do anything. God is shutting down the entire false worship system of Egypt one god at a time. 

_Verse 12_ `“But the LORD ____ Pharaoh’s heart”`. There’s a lesson here. When people keep ignoring the repeated prompting of the Lord over and over again, He will confirm that decision. First Pharaoh hardens his own heart. He makes a decision and digs his heels in. Then _God_ comes along and confirms or firms up the decision Pharaoh already made. Note: If God speaks to you over and over about the same thing…if you are given repeated warnings by _God_, and you do not respond, God will confirm that decision in your heart. Moral: God hardens those who harden themselves.

Romans 1:28 warns us: `“Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a ____ mind, so that they do what ought not to be done”`. God will always choose anger against sin because He is holy. 

```
“Although they ____ God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only 
____ to do these very things but also ____ of those who practice them.” - (NIV Romans 1:32)
```

_God_ is giving Pharaoh chance after chance after chance. He is gracious. But He will also finally confirm the decision in Pharaoh. Please, don’t ever get that far with God. If you die in the condition of rejecting the work of the Holy Spirit as He points you to Christ, there is no hope for salvation. This is what the New Testament refers to as blasphemy of the Holy Spirit. 

God is in the process of making the gospel so absolutely crystal clear through scripture, through believers testimonies, preaching and teaching, evangelism, Christian leaders, and you and me. In our day and age there is no excuse- there is social media, podcasts, video sermons, internet…access to the gospel has never been more available. But here’s the kicker. People still won’t believe. 

<i style='font-size: 1.25em' class="fa-solid fa-skull"></i> &nbsp; _Plague_ **<i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-7"></i>** (Exodus 9:13-35) &bull; _The Plague of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;_

Moses is going to warn Pharaoh again. Let my people go, so that they may worship me. Fill in the blanks for verse 14: `“or this time I will send the ____ of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people, so you may know that there is ____ ____ like me in all the earth”`.

_God_ is going to direct the plagues to their hearts, to the core of who they are. These false gods that you worship, they aren’t real. They don’t exist. But you will know that I DO exist. In verse 16 can you see the reason for the upcoming plagues? God is going to prove that by His power His name will be proclaimed in all the earth. Did that just shake you? 

_Verse 17_ `“You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go”`. God is saying, you’re standing in the way of allowing my people to worship. Anyone who does this is in serious trouble. Don’t ever stand in the way of the work of God and the lives of His people in worship. God is saying, “This town ain’t big enough for both of us. I win.” 

_Verse 18_ `“Therefore, at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm that has ____ ____ on Egypt, from the day it was founded till ____”`.

```
“For then there will be great distress, ____ from the beginning of the world until now - and ____ to be ____ again.” - (NIV Matthew 24:21) 
```

Do you hear the heaviness? This is divine judgment. Matthew is saying that during the great tribulation there will be distress such as the world has never seen. 

Look at _Verse 20_ - there were some Egyptians who were getting the message. The king may not have been listening, but there were officials who were witnessing all of this and feared the word of the _Lord__. Some of the Egyptians were beginning to see the light. They were getting the idea that Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews was not like their gods. There will be many more Egyptians who will also believe and will leave with the children of Israel in the Exodus. Not all the people who left Egypt were Israelites. There were a group of Egyptians who feared the Lord. And that is great hope for us, who will also be grafted into the vine and will enjoy the freedom that comes from being one of _God’s_ children. 

Wrap your brain around this again. Ten times God is going to be patient with Pharaoh and give him a chance to repent. _God_ isn’t judging immediately. There are people who will read this and think, “How can a good God of love do this?” Here’s the thing - be glad I’m not God. There’s no way I wold have put up with this nonsense 10 times. But God did. And that’s important. 

_God_ gave Pharaoh many opportunities to repent. And someone will come along and say, “It’s just unfair that _God_ is going to judge him.” But _God_ gave him time and space. Just like He gave the people in Noah’s daytime and space before the flood. But there is an end to God’s grace and He will judge. The hail and fire (most likely lightning) hit both man and beast and broke every tree in every field…except in Goshen (_Verse 26_). _God_ will send another plague of hailstones in the great tribulation period. Let’s just jump to Revelation 16:17-21. Hailstones weighing 100 pounds are going to do some damage. 

But then in _Verse 27_ Pharaoh says something amazing… `“This time I have sinned.”` Wait. Is that the sound of repentance? He admits that he has sinned. He admits the _Lord_ is in the right and he and his people are wicked.

But this is not real. This is what the Bible calls having a knowledge of _God_ but denying the power thereof. It’s a “form” of godliness. It isn’t true repentance. He doesn’t really mean it. Titus 1:16 says it this way, `“They ____ to know God, but by their ____ they deny him”`. 

Moses knows that this isn’t real repentance as well. (Read _Verse 30_). Hey Pharaoh, I’m really impressed with your little speech back there about _God_ being righteous and you being wicked, and that you’ve sinned… but I’m not buying it. Why didn’t Moses believe him? We don’t know. Perhaps Moses was watching his body language, or hearing the tone in his voice. Or the look in his eye. Whatever the reason, Moses does not believe him. 

We must trust _God_, and respond to him out of love and obedience, not because we want to get out of trouble. The Bible says that even the demons believe that _God_ is, and they tremble before Him. If we just believe that _God_ exists and follow his commands out of fear we are no different from Pharaoh or demons. 

Let’s pull out the blueletterbible.org for one more word study. Look at _Verse 30_. `“But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the ____ ____.”` Moses combines the two titles of God: Yahweh Elohim. 

The word god is Elohim (אֱלֹהִים) <sup>[H430](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h430/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H430")</sup>(it can mean god in a general sense - like the Egyptian gods) but Moses qualifies what he is saying with _Yhwh Elohim_. My God is the God who was, is, and is to come. The Great I Am. _Yhwh_ is not another deity. He is the ONLY deity.

_Verse 31_ gives us a hint at the season. Flax and barley would be in bloom in January or February. The flooding of the Nile happened around July and August. They have been hearing from God for seven months. The last plague (death of the firstborn) will be on Passover, which is in April. From beginning to end it is a nine-month period. 

Katy is going to have her first baby in September, Becca will have her baby in July - by the time we read this she and Becca may be actually joining us in this study with their newborns. It will have also been a 9-month period of waiting. _God_ is going to refer to the Israelites as the _Children of Israel_, and again call them, _Israel, my Firstborn_. 

We are witnessing the birth of a nation. _God_ is giving them a picture of birth pains that are lasting and becoming more frequent and more intense- like the birth of a child.
