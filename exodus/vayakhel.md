# _Vayak'hel_ &sdot; ויקהל
Parashah 22 &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; _He assembled (_ 35:1&mdash;38:20 _)_

The twenty-second reading from the Torah is called Vayak’hel (ויקחל(, which means “and he assembled.” The name comes from the first words of the first verse of the reading, “Moses assembled the whole Israelite community and said to them, ‘These are the things the LORD has commanded you to do:’”

This portion from the Torah describes how the assembly of Israel worked together to build the Tabernacle.

# Day 1 &middot; _Treasure, Time, and Talent_

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Exodus 35:1-21

At the end of Exodus 34 Moses had to have a veil over his face because he was so radiant after speaking with the LORD. He has finished not one, but two 40-day periods of time with Yahweh. And he has called the people together to renew the covenant. 

Yahweh has been instructing Moses on all aspects of the tabernacle, the priesthood, festivals and more. Now, Moses is about to tell the people what has happened while he's been away for almost 3 months. 

Moses' face is glowing. He wears a veil, but as the days go on, the glow fades off of Moses. Read 2 Corinthians 3:13-16 “We are not like &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;, who would put a veil over his face to &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; the Israelites from seeing what was passing away. But their minds were made &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;, for to this day the &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; veil remains when the &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; covenant is read. It has not been removed, because &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; in Christ is it taken away. Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;. But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;.

2 Corinthians 3:18 And we all, who with &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; faces contemplate the Lord’s glory, are being &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; into &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; image with every increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.

Little did Paul know, but in just a few short years from him writing this, in 70 AD, the Romans would destroy the Temple. There have been no sacrifices since 70 AD. The Jewish system is in a pickle because without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins. The old was passing away because it was designed to be temporary. The New Covenant is permanent.

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the first talking point from Moses to the people in verse 2? &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; At the top of the list is the Sabbath. Are you surprised? We need to really come to grips with what God considers a priority. 

Why is the Sabbath even coming up again? Well, God is about to give the people a LOT of work to do. Yahweh is wanting a complete stop from all work, including starting a fire for cooking, metal arts, baking, crafts, etc. 

I got a little convicted of this exact thing this week. I was setting up the workbook pages for this study and decided that I'd color code them for each week's lessons. I have tried to practice not writing this study on Sundays, or doing any work for school, etc. But I drew out a few designs on Sunday not thinking it was “work”. UNTIL this morning when I started to think about this verse. Hold up. Lighting a fire isn’t “work”…it's pre-work. Staring a fire isn’t work...it's pre-work. It’s what you do before you work. 

He is reminding them (and us), once again, to rest. Remember, God is still providing manna and has instructed them to gather a double portion before the Sabbath. Hundreds of years later, Jesus would tell His disciples to rest in him.

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you keep the Sabbath? If so, how? What are some things you should stop doing on the Sabbath? God is telling Israel that the way to be holy in His eyes was to observe the Sabbath. 

Moses calls for an offering from the people. It’s an offering of their treasure, time and talent. This is a freewill offering to the Lord. Exodus 35:5-9 asks for them to bring gold, silver, bronze, etc. (treasure). Exodus 35:10-19 asks for the people to bring their skills (talent). In Exodus 35:20-29 the people left the meeting and everyone who was willing came back to volunteer to work (time).

The Children of Israel came back to be of service to the LORD. That's how God wants us to give- not out of pressure, but out of praise. It’s to be part of our worship, to do this with a generous heart and conscience. The LORD is not looking at how much you give, He's looking for how you give. 

Mark 12:41-44 Jesus is sitting opposite the place where the offerings were put. He watched the crowd putting their monty into the Temple treasury. He saw rich people put in large amounts and a poor widow bringing only a few cents. It’s not the how much...not the amount of money. It’s about where your heart is when you give. The poor woman gave from her heart. She gave everything she had to live on. 

This is absolutely not a ploy to ask for money. I have never heard my dad, Pastor Joe, say, “There are 20 people here who need to give $1,000 in this offering plate.” Sheesh, I can’t even imagine those words coming from him. It's up to God to move a person'a heart, not begging by the leadership. That's coercion. Exodus 35:22 “All who were willing, &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; alike, came.”

If you have children you will know that it is a much different feeling when you have to plead with them to help around the house than it is for them to just do it themselves without being asked. It’s a different heart. 

I remember when I was working for Will Smith. I was making a lot of money. so I upped my tithe at church. When that job ended, I made $zero dollars, and I lost our health insurance. From hero to zero. I couldn’t even return to my classroom because I was “overqualified” to go back and teach. The district could hire a brand new teacher for much less than it would be to take me back. But in that time, I made a decision to keep my tithe the same as it had always been, and I painted the Sunday School rooms and hallways. We ate a lot of pasta and peanut butter. But you know what? In that time, no one in our family got sick and had to go to the doctor. We never went hungry- we didn't have the best tasting meals, but we didn’t starve. Our bills were all paid on time. God provided. He took care of our family in a way I never thought possible. It was one of those times when I saw Luke 6:38 come alive: "Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaking together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you." 

I can't tell you what to do, except to try it. The fact is, it’s the only time in the Bible that God says in Malachi 3:10 “Test me in this,” says the LORD Almighty, “and see if I will not throw open the &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; of heaven and pour out so much &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; that there will not be room enough to store it.

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever tested God in this way? Write down your testimony and come prepared to share when we meet this week! 

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the three things (treasure, time, talent) is God speaking to you about? What does God want from you? If you are willing and your heart is moved, what specifically can you bring to the LORD this year (your time, 
treasure, talent… a combination?)?

# Day 2 &middot; _Stop! That's Enough!_

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Exodus 35:22 through 36:7.

Exodus 35:22 All who were willing, ___ and ___ alike, came and brought gold jewelry of all kinds: brooches, earrings, rings and ornaments. They all presented their gold as a wave offering to the LORD.” 

Men and women. I bring this to your attention because in God's work, men and women work together. Women are not second class citizens. If you get the idea that women are second class citizens, you would be wrong. Miriam was a worship leader, Deborah was a judge, Huldah was a prophetess, and Phoebe was a deacon of the early church. The Samaritan Woman in John 4 was the first evangelist in the New Testament and she brought men to Jesus.

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting on Miriam, Deborah, Huldah, Phoebe, and the Samaritan Woman, what can we learn about the important roles women have played in leadership and ministry throughout biblical history? 

Exodus 35:29 All the Israelite ___ and ___ who were ___ brought to the LORD freewill offerings for all the work the LORD through Moses had commanded them to do

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's about the heart. Were there people who did not give? Of course. There are always those who don't willingly give to the LORD. How can we cultivate a genuine desire to contribute to the building of God's kingdom? 

When I think back at what we've learned about the little snails and the colors they gave, I am filled with awe at when God decides to give wisdom, understanding and knowledge in all manner of workmanship to Bezalel. I'm actually pretty amazed that someone thought if they took a bean off of a bush, roasted it, crushed it, and then put it in hot water, it would make coffee! Who thinks of these things? I'm sure there were many people who wondered how Bezalel could think of all the ways to create his artistic designs and crafts.

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the example of Bezalel, who was filled with wisdom, understanding, and knowledge to create artistic designs for the tabernacle. God empowers him with unique skills and talents. How can we encourage and support each other in discovering and utilizing our gifts for the benefit of the Body of Christ? 

The Children of Israel are going to take up this offering and then they are going to build God a tent in the wilderness. We should also utilize our gifts. We are building up the Body of Christ! 

Ephesians 2:22 And in &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; you too are being &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; together to become a &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; in which God lives by His Spirit.

How awesome would it be to see God's kids come together to use their gifts to build up the Body of Christ? 

There is a common thread in chapters 35 and 36. Your heart must be stirred to give financially, but it also must be stirred by God to serve practically. The bottom line is God wants your heart. He wants you and I to have the right motives when we serve. It’s not about duty, it's about desire. You serve because you desire to build the kingdom. 

Many of you are already volunteering, leading groups, participating in groups, setting up before church, and cleaning up afterwards. This week, Bobby had a meeting in his office after church. I had the opportunity to sit and watch our amazing church volunteers as they served coffee to people, then cleaned up and locked up the building. I heard each door being checked before they went home. It was really humbling to see how much effort they went through. That was a free-will offering of talent and time. 

The people started the construction of the tabernacle. They came to work and offer their services. Now watch what happens. The craftsman are busy, and the people are giving and coming to work on the tabernacle. 

Exodus 36:5 and they said to Moses, “The people are bringing &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; than &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; for doing the work the LORD commanded to be done."

So Moses gave an order throughout the camp in verse 6, “No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.” And so the people were restrained from bringing more. 

They were restrained: shut up, withheld, forbidden to finish. What a great problem to have! Have you ever heard of this happening in the church today? Please stop giving your time and your money to the work of the LORD. It's too much! 

Why were they so giving? Because if you remember, they were given a second chance by God to renew the covenant. Haven't we all been given a second chance by God? They have the right attitude now! 

Story time! 

In a distant village, there were three farmers tilling the soil. A traveler approached them and asked, “What are you doing?” The first farmer, exhausted and grumbling replied, "I'm digging dirt.” The second farmer said, “I'm planting seeds.” The third farmer, filled with joy and purpose exclaimed, “I am participating in the miracle of nature. I am cultivating the land to provide for my family and to sustain our entire community.” 

Like the farmers, we all have different perspectives on our work. Some see serving the church as a monotonous task, some see it as an obligation in the process of laying a spiritual foundation, and some see it as an opportunity for artistic expression and a way to contribute to God’s kingdom.

# Day 3 &middot; _Going to Church with Moses_

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you grow up going to church on Sundays? What do you remember about the service of your childhood church? Did you know that our houses of worship have a remarkable lineage that can be traced back to the assembly at 
Mount Sinai?

When Moses gathered the entire congregation of God's people together at Mount Sinai, it became a significant moment in history. He assembled them with a purpose - to instruct and guide them in constructing the holy tabernacle. The churches and synagogues we attend today are living descendants of that initial assembly in the wilderness. Isn’t that cool? 

As the children of Israel constructed the Tabernacle in the wilderness, they referred to it as the ‘Tent of Meeting” because it served as their place of meeting with God. They assembled there at God's appointed times: for daily sacrifices, the Sabbath, new moons, and the biblical festivals. It was during those gatherings that they listened to the Torah being read aloud.

During the reign of King Solomon, the Tent of Meeting became the permanent Temple of stone in Jerusalem.

After the return from captivity, when the people returned to Jerusalem under the leadership of Ezra and Nehemiah, the local assembly emerged. These local gatherings were called synagogues (from the Greek word meaning “assembly”). Just as in the Temple, there was reading of Scripture, prayers and worship. The synagogue services reflected the Temple services, minus the blood sacrifices. 

As the early church grew in number they met in home churches. The early believers also met at the appointed times for prayer, worship and Torah readings. 

Our modern churches carry this legacy. 

Hebrews 10:24-25 says, “And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another - and all the more as you see the Day approaching.”

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you think that God insists that we assemble together? I’m sure there are people who think that it would be a lot easier to stay home and worship instead of deal with all of the congregational issues. They won’t have hurt feelings or personal disappointments. Plus, you can stay in your pajamas. It's all the same, right?

I once heard someone say that people are like rocks. When rocks are left untouched, they retain their rough and unrefined nature. However, when they are gathered together in a tumbler, the rocks collide, striking against each other and gradually wearing away their hard edges. In the process, they become more polished. God intends to shape and refine our souls, just as the rocks are polished through their interactions.


&nbsp;
# Day 4 &middot; _The Lost Tabernacle_

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Exodus 37:1-9, Exodus 37:17-23 and 1 Samuel 4:1-11. 

The Ark of the Covenant has a pretty interesting history. In 1 Samuel 4, Israel carried the Ark into battle against the Philistines. After all, the only person who got to see the ark was the high priest - and only once a year. They wanted to bring it into battle with them. They were desperate for God’s help to win the battle, but they were wrong in how they sought that help. Instead of repenting, they turned to methods that God never approved of. They were basically “forcing” God to fight for them, at the very least God would be a "good luck charm.” Sounds brilliant, right? No doubt they were 
pretty proud of their clever thinking. 

When the Ark of the Covenant came into the camp, all of Israel shouted so loudly that the earth shook. Wow! Sounds like a really amazing church service, doesn't it? Except that it was all show. The noise meant nothing without God's truth. 

It seems that the only people who were afraid of God were the Philistines. Immediately they knew that Yahweh struck down the Egyptians and led the Israelites through the wilderness. They didn't know much about God except He was powerful, obviously much more powerful than their gods. Knowledge wasn't their problem…submission to God was. Instead of giving up, it made the Philistines fight even harder. 

Israel ended up being defeated by the courage of desperate men. They thought it would be an easy battle, and didn't even try hard. Plus, they lacked God's blessing. Their problem? They believed in the Ark, and not the power of God. 

Don’t be fooled into thinking that if God is with you, you don't need to try hard, or that life will be easy. God did not bless their twisting of His word. 

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read 1 Samuel 5:1-5.

The Philistines placed the Ark next to their god, Dagon, as a trophy. But the next morning, Dagon had fallen on its face before the Ark! So they set him up again. This time Dagon was face to the ground and both of his hands were broken off only the torso was left. The Philistines decided it would be smart to return the Ark back to Israel! Ha! 

When the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple in 586 BC, the Ark vanished. No one knows what happened to it. The Jews have built replicas of all the other Temple furnishings, except for the Ark. There are so many stories and theories of where it is, the stories are pretty entertaining, actually!

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think the ark will ever be found, until we get to heaven. In Revelation 11:19, when John was brought up to heaven, what did he see? ___ Yep! There it is!

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Jeremiah 3:16-17. What do you think, will the Ark be found?

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;What legends can you find online about the Ark? 

The Lamp Stand also has many stories and legends. One of the most famous legends is the story of Hanukkah. When the Temple was destroyed (before Jesus), and the menorah was taken, they only found enough olive oil for one day. It would take 8 days to make the olive oil needed for the menorah. Not knowing what to do, they did the best they could. They lit it, fully expecting the oil to burn out on the same day. Miraculously, the oil lasted for 8 days, until the new oil could be made. Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days because of the miracle of the oil that burned for 8 days. 

When the Romans destroyed the Temple in 70 AD, Titus carried off its treasures, including the menorah. No lone knows what happened to it after that. Is it in the Vatican? There's no evidence, just hearsay.

# Day 5 &middot; _The Altar of Incense_

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Exodus 37:25-29

One of my favorite stories of the Altar of Incense is of Zechariah! The job of offering incense was a coveted duty. The priest who offered incense came as close to the holy of holies as a common priest could come. By the time of the New Testament, the priesthood was so large that caring for the incense was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
