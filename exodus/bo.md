# _Bo_ &sdot; בא
Parashah 15 &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; _Go (_ 10:1&mdash;13:16 _)_

The fifteenth reading from the Torah is named _Bo_ (בא)<sup>[H935](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h935/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H935")</sup>, which means _Go_. The title comes from the first words of the first verse of the reading, which say, `“Then the Lord said to Moses, ‘[Go] to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart”` (Exodus 10:1)

&nbsp;
# Day 1 &middot; _How Long?_

Believing in Christ is like being a tea bag. The hot water is trials and anything that comes into our life to derail us. When this hot water comes, we find out what we are made of. Will you be able to endure the heat and come out strong? Maybe you can’t stand the heat and come out watered down? Want to see what’s inside a person? Bump them a little. You’ll see if that tea is strong or weak. We are about to see Moses’ strength. The water is heating up. 

If I’ve learned anything from this story so far, it is how amazingly patient God is. But here’s the thing. We can often misinterpret God’s patience and think He’s weak or doesn’t care, or even that He approves of our sins. You may think, “I’ve done this wrong thing for so long and God hasn’t stopped me yet, it must be ok.” 

The plagues inflicted upon Egypt, such as the bloody water, hail, boils, and locusts, may appear to us as ancient and outdated, something that only backward nations would experience. Some people think that if these plagues were to occur in our modern age, they would likely have a more high-tech and futuristic origin, such as nuclear bombs, bioweapons, and failing electrical grids. But each of these events would be just as catastrophic today as they were three thousand years ago in Egypt. Think about it. Nature can have devastating results, no help from man needed.

Read Exodus 10:1-20

Verse 1: The LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart. The fact that Pharaoh still would not submit to the LORD showed that he didn’t know who the LORD was yet. This was despite the face that the LORD God made it clear that He was greater than Hapi, Isis, Osiris and Khnum (the gods of the Nile). He was greater than Heqet (the frog goddess). He was greater than Geb (the earth god). He was greater than Uatchit (the god of the flies and scarab beetles). He was greater than Apis and Hathor (the cattle god and goddess). He was greater than Nut (the sky goddess) and Imhotep (the god of medicine and healing). _Yhwh_ was able to stop the whole worship of Egyptian gods with disgusting lice and swarms of insects. And despite all of this, Pharaoh showed he still did not know the LORD God. Therefore, God would show him more. 

Verse 10:2 `“…that you may tell your ____ and ____ how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them, and that you may know that ____ ____ the ____"`.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>The Torah is very clear about the importance of remembering. Without remembering there is no gratitude and no faith. It’s only when people remember the good that has been done that they are grateful. But it’s so easy to remember the bad things that have been done. Why is that? Why is it that being grateful takes so much effort, but resentment is effortless?

&nbsp;

These first two verses in chapter 10 asks the Israelites to remember and recount to every generation what God had done for them. Why? Because when we forget what God has done, we also lose faith in him. This is key. Without remembering what God has done for us in the past, we are likely to say, “What has God done for me lately?” Hindsight is 20/20. Focus on what you know. The here and now is clouded by our circumstances and present trouble- it is not a clear vision of what God is doing in our lives. It’s not until the storm passes that we can see God’s hand in our lives. 

What two-word question did God ask in verse 3? God asks, “How long?” How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Make note of this. 

Moses is standing up against the ruler of a nation and asking him, “How long are you going to refuse to listen?” And if Pharaoh thinks Moses has been bugging him so far, he’s really got a surprise coming when he sees the locusts! Pharaoh’s problem is his pride. He simply did not want to give it to God. It’s an important question that God would ask to anyone: “How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me?”

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>These locusts are going to cover the face of the ground with such thickness that you won’t be able to see the earth! GROSS! One time I was traveling to Texas to do some Professional Development for Discovery. When we landed, there were thousands and thousands of grasshoppers all over the parking lot. I was so freaked out that they had the guts to jump toward me and not away from me. I never ran through a parking lot so carefully and quickly! Some day I’ll want to watch that on a rerun. Looking back it was hysterical. But being there was terrifying! But in verses 5-6, it lists all the things that these locusts will do. What are they?

&nbsp;

Now, watch this. In verse 7, Pharaoh’s officials also ask a “How long” question. What is it?

Verse 7 “Pharaoh’s officials said to him, ‘How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the Lord their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?’” Pharaoh’s officials saw what Pharaoh refused to see… this Egyptian king was no match for the God of Israel. Pharaoh wants to know who will be going on this trip. They are begging Pharaoh. Even Pharaoh’s servants know that Egypt is being destroyed by these plagues. 

Think about this. In Genesis, Joseph was able to bring the entire country of Egypt out of starvation through his policies. Then in Exodus, Moses brings the whole country, the same country, to the brink of starvation. Here’s what is interesting about that. (This is a God pattern.) The results of both Joseph’s and Moses’ policies are directly proportional to how the Egyptians treated the Jewish people. It was the policies made by this pharaoh who forgot Joseph, his policies toward Israel and the Jewish people, that is ruining Egypt and his people see it. That’s why they ask, “how long?” 

Pharaoh finally says, “Go, worship the LORD your God” in verse 8. That’s good news! Then he asks, “But tell me who will be going?” That’s not so good. Pharaoh has done this before. He’s tried to compromise before. 

Verse 9 `“Moses answered, ‘We will go with our ____ and our ____, with our ____ and our ____ and with our ____ and ____, because we are to celebrate a festival to the Lord.”`

Moses is looking out for the entire Jewish people…including the most vulnerable- children, the elderly, and women. God wants every generation. He wants your sons, and daughters, young and old, to know the story- and to pass that story on. 

If you have a child in school right now, that child spends approximately 20% of their time each week going to school. About 1% (2 hours a week) is spent in church. That leaves the rest, 79%, under your care. That’s an investment. Your children are precious. God is telling Moses to pass these remembrances onto the children. Don’t let them forget. 

Pharaoh answers Moses in verse 10: “The Lord be with you—if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly, you are bent on evil. No! Have only the men go and worship the Lord, since that’s what you have been asking for.” This is kind of comical because Pharaoh is warning Moses, “Be careful Moses. If you go out there it’s going to be dangerous.” Oh, is it NOT dangerous in Egypt with all the plagues happening? 

The world has this same mindset today. The world will tell you, “Ok, be fanatical, but don’t impose your beliefs on your children. Let them decide for themselves. If you want to be a Christian, be a secret agent. Don’t take this too far. Tame it down. Do your ‘religious thing’ but leave your families with us.” 

<i style='font-size: 1.25em' class="fa-solid fa-skull"></i> &nbsp; _Plague_ **<i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-8"></i>** (Exodus 10:12) &bull; _The Plague of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;_

As in the plagues that came before, God is using natural forces to bring judgment on Egypt. The Egyptians believed in many gods. So they either believed in the authority of the God of Israel, or at the very least that something had gone wrong with their gods. The Egyptians had to make a choice that we also have to make- was this all a coincidence, or what is God? Is life just a series of coincidences, or is God in control? 

The locusts ate everything green in Egypt. Just imagine your home with absolutely nothing green around it because of locusts. The land was dark with these bugs. Nothing remained green on the trees or plants throughout all of Egypt. The Egyptians prayed to a god who was depicted as a locust. Obviously he wasn’t doing anything. And there was also the god Serapis- who protected the vegetation from the locust. Again, she must have been on vacation. The god of protection of crops, Set, is also MIA. One by one the false gods are being directly attacked.

I’m praying that God will do for us what he did for Pharaoh (hold on now, hear me out)- I am praying that God expose and topple every false god and idol in our lives. When we trust in these gods it hurts to see them fall, but it is always best to have them exposed

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Study Question 3** </span><br/><br/>What do you worship besides God? Worship is the giving of devotion, reverence, or importance to something or someone. Is it material possessions, power and authority, self-image and vanity, fame, technology, sports? Where does most of your time go? What is it that consumes your thoughts that is not holy? Take time to repent and surrender it to God. 

&nbsp;

In verse 16, Pharaoh does something that makes you take a double look. He says, `“I have ______ against the LORD your God and against you”`.

This statement is not what it appears at first glance. It looks like Pharaoh is repenting. But Pharaoh is a polytheist. So he believed that a person could sin before one god while doing nothing wrong in the eyes of another. He definitely knows that he has sinned against Yahweh, but cannot admit that he is wrong because he doesn’t believe he is. Obviously, Moses’ God is prevailing over him, so the only conclusion is that he must have done something offensive to this God. Pharaoh takes a step of repentance, but will he take the step of being willing to turn away from sin and follow the Lord’s way? It’s one thing to admit you are wrong, but you can do that every day. I’m a sinner today, and I’ll be a sinner tomorrow. Ok. Admitting it is good. But what are you going to do about it? 

```
“_______ sorrow brings repentance that leads to ____ and leaves no ____, but ____ sorrow brings ____.” (NIV 2 Corinthians 7:10)
```

Pharaoh is not sorry because he is repenting. This is the sorrow of the world, “I’m so sorry because this hurts me. I’m not willing to change anything about my lifestyle. I’ve been caught, so I’ll confess to make the pain go away.” Verse 17: `“Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the LORD your God to take this deadly plague away from me”`. Just like an abuser who asks for forgiveness, he only wants to be forgiven once more. After this he will be a good Pharaoh…

<i style='font-size: 1.25em' class="fa-solid fa-skull"></i> &nbsp; _Plague_ **<i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-9"></i>** (Exodus 10:21) &bull; _The Plague of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;_

Verse 21 `“Then the LORD said to Moses, ‘Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt darkness that can be _______’”`. Yikes. _Darkness_ covered the land of Egypt for three days. They did not see one another, nor did they even get up from their place. Yet all of the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. 

Let’s jump over the [blueletterbible.org](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2822/kjv/wlc/0-1/) and look at the word _Darkness_ (חֹשֶׁךְ)<sup>[H2822](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2822/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H2822")</sup>. What does it mean? Where else do you see this kind of darkness? In Genesis 1:2. It is not only the physical absence of light, it is _Misery_, _Destruction_, _Sorrow_, _Wickedness_ and _Death_. Have you ever experienced that kind of darkness? Have you ever been so scared you could not move? But this is a darkness that does not end for three days. In their minds, I’m sure after what seemed like a full day they wondered if they would ever see light again. Yes, visual darkness was present. The Egyptians certainly had 
oil lamps that they used during the nighttime hours. They knew how to deal with the dark. This was not simply 3-24 hour periods of nighttime. Their lamps did not produce the light they desperately needed. I’m sure they were straining to see light somewhere, anywhere…but there was none. 

When Jesus was dying on the cross, darkness covered the earth for 3 hours. (Matthew 27:45) Why? Because the greatest sin ever committed from a human vantage point is to put God on a cross and get rid of Him. 

We have darkness in Egypt, and darkness at the cross. Let’s connect one more dot. The day of the Lord is also called the great tribulation period. It will be in our future. The book of Joel describes this as a day of darkness and gloom. It is the same word _Chosek_ (חֹשֶׁךְ)<sup>[H2822](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2822/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H2822")</sup>. They could not see anything evil or dangerous, but they could sense it. It was a time of horror. It is not just physical, but spiritual also. 

Yet, in _Goshen_ there was light. [blueletterbible.org](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h216/kjv/wlc/0-1/) - the word for _Light_ (אוֹר)<sup>[H216](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h216/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H216")</sup> in verse 23 is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; It means: &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; Israel had clarity and prosperity… _Light_! I want to live in that kind of _Light_! While Egypt was experiencing horrific darkness, Israel was celebrating with joy! 

We, who are covered by God’s light, live in the same world with those who live under a blanket of spiritual darkness. ONLY Israel received light. We, non-Jews, are blessed to be joined with Israel through Jesus. And this light benefits us as well! In Revelation 9:1-11 and Revelation 16:10-11, both locusts and darkness will come again. 

This is a direct assault against the sun god _Ra_. This god’s light is not only gone, the darkness can be physically felt. 

Now Pharaoh sends out an urgent call for Moses. He is going to let all of Israel go… however, the livestock must be left behind. Moses declines. Everything must go. Why? Because _Yhwh_ has called them to sacrifice, but they don’t know exactly what would be involved.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Study Question 4** </span><br/><br/>Here’s another God principle. God wants all that we are and have. We don’t know what he will demand of us, but He wants it all. He wants your talent, your treasure, your time. What are you holding back from giving to God? Your job? Your family? Bring it all to _Yhwh_. Here’s the thing, whatever they would have left behind would have been in servitude of Pharaoh. So, if you bring everything, except your children…then they are left in bondage. Bring it ALL. God has made it clear that EVERYTHING we are is to be given to Him. Thoughts?

&nbsp;

But the Lord hardened pharaoh’s heart and he would not let them go. In verse 28 Pharaoh says, “Get out of my sight! Make sure that you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die.” He is basically telling Moses, “Watch yourself”. It’s a threat- “Watch your step!” There is no more negotiating. There will be no more opportunities to avoid judgment. Listen, God does not strive with man forever (Genesis 6:3). We do not know when the end hour is, but when it comes, and God decides to turn us over to our wickedness, there is no hope of redemption. This is a scary thought.



&nbsp;
# Day 2 &middot; _Judgement_

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 11

&nbsp;

What is judgment? It’s when we receive what is due to us, according to God’s system of justice. I am almost afraid to write any more in this chapter because, doesn’t that say it all? Judgment is almost always a negative consequence. All of us, saved and unsaved, will be judged. If we’re saved, however, Jesus will stand before us and we will not be condemned. He has already paid our price. If we are not saved, we will be condemned. 

Verse 1: `“Now the LORD had said to Moses, “I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt”`. This word _Plague_ is something far more grievous. It means _Stroke_, a _Blow_, an _Affliction_. Up until now, Moses did not know the number of plagues. Now he knows there are 10, and this one will be the biggest and most horrible. 

In chapter 10, Pharaoh has kicked Moses out, and has told him to watch his step- that he will be killed if he ever sees him again. Yet, Moses is still here in chapter 11. (I would have hightailed it immediately…which is probably yet another reason why I am not in the Bible!) 

Moses has one more speech to deliver before he actually leaves Pharaoh’s presence. Moses is going to ask for back wages. (Brave, right?) They’ve worked for free as slaves long enough. Now it’s time to pay them before they leave. What will they do with all the gold and silver…they are going to build a tabernacle. They will need garments and furnishings, and all of these curtains, Egyptian cotton and utensils are going to come from Egypt.

Verse 2: `"Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their ____ for articles of silver and gold”`. Who are their neighbors? The Egyptians. They are going to ask their slave masters, who have been traumatized by the plagues, for their gold and silver. The Israelites were slaves. They did not have gold and silver. Everything they received to make the Tabernacle was gotten by the Egyptians who could not wait for them to leave. This word, _Neighbor_ (רֵעַ)<sup>[H7453](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7453/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H7453")</sup> is also the same word used in Leviticus 19:18 when God tells them `“Love you neighbor as yourself”`. I suppose it’s easy to love the people you live next to when they are kind and wave to you on the road…but what if those same people owned you? 

To the bulk of the Egyptian people, Moses is a powerful sorcerer, more powerful than Egypt’s magicians. They had no interest in testing him further. To this day, the Egyptians see this as a theft… even 3400 years later! 

Moses lays out exactly what will happen that very night at midnight. Why do all of the Egyptians have to suffer this plague of the firstborn death? 

1. Let’s roll this book back to the beginning. Do you remember when Pharaoh wanted to kill all of the male babies of the Jews and drown them in the river? God is paying Pharaoh back in a currency that Pharaoh understands. He’s using his own language. 
2. All of the Egyptians shared in the enslavement of the Jewish people. 
3. God is no respecter of persons- not the poor or the wealthy. No one is exempt from His judgment. 
4. What is happening in Egypt is going to happen again in Revelation 20. John says, “And I saw great and small all standing before the throne of God to be judged.” This is a preview for Revelation. 

Just as the Israelites could not prevent their newborn babies from being drowned in the Nile, now, in an act of measure-for measure, the Egyptians will feel what it is like to not be able to protect their children. This is a nightmare for all parents

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 2 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>What are the differences between the people of Egypt and the people of Israel in verses 6-7?

&nbsp;

In verse 4 I just read something that I didn’t see before. `“This is what the LORD [all capitals] says: ‘About midnight I will go throughout Egypt’”`. I always pictured a smoke or _Death Angel_ coming through the streets. Let’s be clear, it was _Yhwh_ Himself who took those lives, and it will be _Yhwh_, Himself, who will judge at the last judgement. 

God, and God alone, will kill the firstborn. This brings up a lot of questions…one of them being, If God is good then how does this add up? But here’s the thing, it’s one thing to question God and other to reject God because of our questions. 

God has made promises to Pharaoh and Egypt. He has been gracious in giving them plenty of time to repent. But he is also 
a just God.

After this last judgment, Pharaoh will not only release the Israelites, he is going to drive them out of Egypt. 

In verse 7 God is going to remind us of his distinction between God’s people and all others. When God keeps repeating something, we should pay attention. 

* In the book of Genesis, God chooses Abraham and his descendants as his special people, and he establishes a covenant with them. 
* In the book of Exodus 33 God tells Moses that the Israelites are a _Distinctive People_ among the nations. 
* In the book of Leviticus, God commands the Israelites to separate themselves from the surrounding nations and to be holy, because God has set them apart for Himself. In the book of Deuteronomy, God reminds the Israelites that they are a chosen people and urges them to remain faithful to him. 
* In the New Testament, Jesus teaches that his followers are to be in the world but not of the world, and he prays for their protection from the evil one. 
* In 2 Corinthians 6, Paul quotes Isaiah 52:11 and urges believers to `"come out from them [unbelievers] and be separate"` and to not touch anything unclean. 
* In the book of Revelation, God separates his faithful people from those who reject him, and he promises eternal life to those who remain faithful.

Let’s never think that this idea of believers being separate from the rest of the world was a minor or remote issue. This is not obsolete. Egypt is a “type” of the world. To this very day, and to the end of time, God has seen and will see the world as two groups: Israel, and everybody else. Where does that leave Gentile believers? With Israel! When God tells us to bless Israel, He is also having us bless ourselves. (Read Romans 9-11 for more information.) We have been grafted into the vine of Israel. From God’s perspective, Gentile believers (those of us who trust Jesus as Lord and Messiah) are grafted into the covenants of Israel. We are not made physical Jews, but spiritually welcomed into the family of God. 

Israel was set apart to be God’s special people. We use the word _Sanctify_ (קָדַשׁ)<sup>[H6942](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6942/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H6942")</sup> … that just means to be set apart for God. This OT idea is not done away with, but embraced in the NT. Jesus didn’t come to do away with this set apartness, He came to provide a new way for Gentiles to be accepted into His family. Even the New Covenant was not between God and Gentiles; it was between God and Israel. 

_Yhwh_ is going to knock down one last Egyptian false god, the god Osiris: the god of the afterlife. When an Egyptian died, they went to the land of Osiris and Isis (his wife and sister). It was her job to protect the children. Both of these gods and goddesses are being attacked in this last plague. Pharaoh is also being personally attacked, as he is seen as a god. 

There’s a lot of talk about firstborns in Genesis and Exodus. Have you noticed that? The firstborn child was the next in line, the heir of the family. Very often, that firstborn was skipped and the blessing went to the second. (Instead of Ishmael, it went to Isaac. Instead of Esau, it went to Jacob.) Perhaps God is foreshadowing a need for a second birth… our first birth (our sinful nature), and then our being born again in Christ! Jesus said in John 3:3, `“unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God”`. Our first birth is man’s attempt at the blessing, but it it not good enough. We must have a second birth. 

Have you made a decision for Christ? Are you certain that if you die tonight you will be in Heaven? Have you had a spiritual rebirth? If not, you need to make that decision. Do not harden your heart against the Lord. He may come and confirm that harden decision. 

Let’s take a closer look at this timeline. It is during the dark days on Egypt that Moses announces the death of the firstborn. Egypt is in complete darkness, scared out of their wits, with an evil blanket on them. But Israel is celebrating with joy in full sunlight! In fact, while Egypt was in complete darkness, Israel was already selecting their Passover lambs. Take a quick peak 1400 years later. It is now approximately 30 AD. Jesus and his disciples have had Passover together. Now Jesus is on the cross, dying for us. But before death comes, the land suddenly becomes covered in thick darkness. Jesus, the Passover Lamb of God, was selected and sacrificed when all was dark- literally and spiritually. Yet… in heaven, great joy and celebration was taking place- for the deliverance of the world was taking place. Jesus, the Passover Lamb, was saving the lives of millions of people from the past, present and into our future. Doesn’t that just give you chills? 

Now, jump with me 2000 years in the future to present time. Does the world seem like it is getting darker and darker to you? Spiritually, our planet is evil and rebellious. It is so easy to become anxious and confused. But for believers, what should our reaction be? It should be the same as the Jews in Egypt and the heavenliness at the crucifixion… celebration! Our deliverance is coming! It is so close! 

When we start living from God’s perspective, and not from our own short-sightedness, we can live in victory!

# Day 3 &middot; _Have You Been Passed Over?_

No one likes being ignored, avoided, discounted or rejected. Those things weigh us down. But being “passed over” in this chapter is a welcome exception! 

I am not, nor I ever been, an athlete. I’m sure that every student team captain in my middle school knew that fact, too! Getting picked for teams was painful. I can still remember waiting as the best players were picked first. Getting passed over is not fun. Ever feel like this? Ever feel like you’re working hard, only to be passed over?

I can think of many examples of where I’d LOVE to get passed over for… a speeding ticket, a cavity filled, a colonoscopy, having embarrassing video taken of me and shown on Facebook (cough cough Jannita). I wouldn’t mind at all avoiding those opportunities! Right?! (Can I hear an _Amen_ from someone?)

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 12:1-28

&nbsp;

At first glance, you will notice this chapter is pretty long. More time spent on this last plague than any other. Why is that? Because God is 
reminding them of His covenant of a blood sacrifice. There are four things we can learn from this chapter. I want you to come back and write your thoughts down as you learn. This chapter tells us about:

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 3 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>1. Our _Sin_<br/><br/>Do we really understand how expensive sin is? In verse 12 God tells them `“I will execute judgements against all the gods of Egypt”`. He is using words like _Judgment_, _Plague_, _Death_, and _Strike Down_. Romans 6:23 says, `“The wages of sin is death”`. Sin is expensive. It costs life. It takes life. This plague is the final face-off between _Yhwh_ and the Egyptian gods. They are trusting in gods who cannot perform what _Yhwh_ is about to perform. This is a judgment on pharaoh himself. In Exodus 5:2 he asked, “Who is the _Lord_ that I should obey Him?” Well, he’s about to find out! But the children of Israel are also under the death sentence, and only blood can save them. It did not matter that they were chosen at that point. If they didn’t apply the blood and follow God’s instructions, they would be a victim as well

&nbsp;

Why did the Israelites deserve punishment as much as the Egyptians? First, They were obstinate. They had been praying for a deliverer, God brought them Moses, and they rejected God’s messenger. Second, some of them were worshipping the false gods of Egypt (we’ll learn more about that in Joshua 24). They were not protected. This is not about being a “good person”, this is about obedience and following God’s Word.

Our _Substitute_ <br/><br/>As an act of mercy God provides a substitute, a yearling lamb. It had to be perfect, with no defect. It had to be whole. It had to be inspected. It was a substitute for the whole family- it stood in the place of the family. It literally took their place in the judgment. 

&nbsp;

Now get this. They take the lamb in on the 10th day. They feed it. They pet it. They care for it. It lives with them. The children become attached. It’s in their home for 4 days before the father kills it and spills blood all over the white wool. It’s shocking. It might be a little scary for the children. But that blood is going to be in the place of the firstborn child. As that young child runs up to the father and cries, “Why Daddy? Why do you have to do this?” The dad is going to have to explain, this is your substitute. 

This lamb was chosen four days in advance so that there would be no last-minute arrangements and the possibility of haphazardly putting together a meal of gratitude. This celebration is going to have gratitude and remembrance all over it from the gathering of an entire family, to the meal itself.

In Genesis, Adam and Eve sin and cover themselves with fig leaves. (I’m not sure what the fashion statement is, but it couldn’t have been comfortable.) Do you remember what happens? God covers them with animal skins. In order for that to happen, it will require death of an animal. That was the first sacrifice. Later, God is going to establish [Yom Kippur](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/yom-kippur-101/), the _Day of Atonement_. A lamb will be killed, but this time for an entire nation. 

There is one lamb for a person; one lamb for a family; one lamb for a nation. Redemption (a life for a life) was both personal and national. But wait. There is one more lamb that we must not forget. When Jesus comes to the Jordan River in John 1:29, _John the Baptist_ cries out, `“Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the WORLD”`. 

Do you have chills? I do! This is a message that is a pattern in the Bible. To get to God, you need a lamb. You are not going to get to heaven based on merit, or good behavior. God is going to ask you one question, “Where’s the Lamb in your life?”

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 3 &#8729; Study Question 3** </span><br/><br/>3. Our _Salvation_<br/><br/> Let’s get a little more specific on this. God doesn’t only require a lamb, He requires a dead lamb. This chapter is super bloody…which is not one of my favorite topics (I get a little squeamish at blood). But there is blood everywhere in this chapter. Killing an animal is not a tidy activity. Then blood is going to be put into some kind of container so they can dip hyssop branches into it and apply the blood to their doorposts. There is going to be blood everywhere. Why? Blood represents life. Leviticus 17:11 tells us `“For the life of the flesh is in the blood”`. It’s a sign that a life has been ended, but it is a substitute for your life being ended. 

&nbsp;

They are going to put blood on the top of their doorposts and on the sides. And you know what, that blood is going to drip down and cover the bottom of the doorway. If it was me, and I knew that Yahweh was going to see this blood and pass over it, I would be putting LOTS of extra blood on there for good measure. This blood is what covered their sins. When _Yhwh_ came, and saw the sign of blood on the door, He knew a death already occurred in that house. The penalty had been paid. The wrath of God was turned away. God will not be against them. 

What is the _Death Angel’s_ name? (Exodus 12:23)

When we look at the cross, and see the spotless Lamb. When His blood was shed, I want you to notice something. There is blood at the top of the cross (where the crown of thorns covered Jesus’ head); blood on the two sides from his hands, and if you looked beneath that cross, you’d see blood puddled at the foot of the cross. And you know what else you’d see? You’d see that your sin, what you have done to Christ in the past, all the times when you were obstinate, worshipping false gods, and rejecting God’s message… all those sins will be washed in that blood. Jesus’ blood covers everything. God looks at you, but only sees His Son’s blood. A sacrifice has already been made. A life was ended to save yours. You are forever safe because Jesus was your substitute. 

Our only response should be to bow down and worship Him. Thank Him for paying a price we could never have paid. He suffered so we would’t have to. How do you say thank you to a God who paid so much just to have a relationship with you? Peter calls it the _Precious_ blood of Jesus Christ. It couldn’t have been said better. 

Why is it so precious? Because it didn’t cover one person, or a family, or even a nation. Jesus’ blood covered the whole world, then and into the future. His death touches our own lives 2000 years later. Non-Christians look at the cross as silliness. It makes no sense. Why do we talk about the blood of Jesus? It’s gross. Yep. It is. But our sin is grosser.

Our own _Selves_<br/><br/> There is a change about to take place for the children of Israel. Their future is going to dramatically change after the Passover. The Passover is so significant that the nation of Israel had to rearrange and reset their calendar. God is saying it’s a new year. It’s a do-over. (Do you need a do-over?) God was teaching them to link even their measuring of time to his calling on their lives. The Passover happens in the spring. Isn’t it kind of amazing that that is also a symbol of new beginnings? Coincidence?

&nbsp;

This year I got to spend Passover with a _Messianic Jewish_ family. It was an experience and interactive for all ages. The kids take part in games and asking questions. At one point they all run around the house to find the afikoman (you’ll see more about this in tomorrow’s video lesson) and they get a monetary reward if they do. It’s a time for family and remembering. 

This Passover didn’t just change their future, it changed their families! 

One lamb can make all the difference! Praise the _Lord_, we have been passed over!

# Day 4 &middot; _Shadows of Christ in the Passover_

This will be a shorter devotional because of the video.

?> <span style="font-size:1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-tv"></i> &nbsp; **Watch** |</span> Shadows of Christ in the Passover

Contrary to popular belief, the New Testament celebration of communion did not originate with Jesus at the Last Supper. The foundation of communion is the Passover festival- established 1450 years before Christ was born. But like all of the Old Testament, everything points toward the Messiah. Every story, every hero, every book points to the need for someone who comes to restore our relationship back to God. It’s why I named this series _Shadows of the Messiah_ in the first place. I want everyone to see why the Old Testament is so crucial for understanding who Jesus is. 

In Matthew 5:17 Jesus Himself says, “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.” When the Bible refers to the “Law” it is referring to the Mosaic Law- the Torah. Jesus didn’t come to do away with the Torah, he came to fulfill it. He came to give it the fullest meaning possible. The Bible tells us that before we came to Christ we were dead, dead on arrival. We were born spiritually alienated from God. Then, at some point, we got born again! And our new life started when Jesus became the center. 

I want to go back to one important thing that I read in Exodus 12:3-5. I hope you see this progression. In verse 3, you’ll notice the term “A lamb” (or “an animal” depending on your version). The whole community must each select a lamb. In verse 4, you have “THE lamb”. You should apportion the lamb. And in verse 5, it says, “YOUR lamb shall be without blemish.” So you have “a lamb, the lamb, your lamb.” 

This is a spiritual progression. There are many people who see Jesus as a lamb. He’s a good moral teacher, He’s a good example. But there comes a day when the Holy Spirit convicts your own heart, your own sin, and you see a need for the lamb. Jesus is not just “a” lamb, He is “the” Lamb! He’s the answer you’ve been looking for! 

But when you go from _a Lamb_, to _the Lamb_, to _Your Lamb_ - that’s a glorious day. It’s personalized. That’s the day you receive that Lamb to yourself. 

Galatians 2:20 says, `“____ have been crucified with Christ and ____ no longer live, but Christ lives in ____. The life ____ now live in the body, ____ live by faith in the Son of God, who loved ____ and gave himself for ____”`. He is a lamb, The Lamb, Your Lamb! 

The Passover is the most striking foreshadowing of the cross of all the festivals in the Old Testament. But in case you’ve forgotten, here’s another:

Genesis 22. Abraham has lead his one and only promised son to a mountain. Isaac asks his father, “The fire and wood are here, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” Abraham responds, “God Himself will provide the lamb!” (Again, chills, right?! Don’t you see all the pointers? The entire narrative of the Bible is pointing in one direction. 

Isaiah 54 also points to Jesus when Isaiah says, (verse 7) `“He was led like a ____ to the slaughter”`.

_John the Baptist_ also points it out in John 1:29, `“Behold, the ____ of God, who takes away the sin of the world!”`

And we can go on. Look up the following: 1 Corinthians 5:7, 1 Peter 1:18, Revelation 5:6, and Revelation 13:8 to name a few. 

All the way through the Bible it points to the lamb. And the Passover lamb is where it begins in terms of the full foreshadowing of what the cross would do.

&nbsp;
# Day 5 &middot; _The Night Nobody Slept_

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 12:29-13:6

This is when the real drama starts in this book. This is the night that nobody slept. Read verse 29-32. 

All of Egypt was touched. Every family. Not one house was spared. 

Pharaoh finally had enough. His precious son was dead. The Egyptians were finally broken. So the Egyptians gave the Israelites all their dough… (literally, and also real money) before it had been given leaven (yeast), with all the tools, wrapped it in their own clothing and gave it away. But that was not all. The Egyptians also gave them articles of silver and gold. And in this way they plundered the Egyptians. 

Nobody has ever packed their bags faster than the Israelites did on that night. I’m sure there were Egyptians who wished that Pharaoh would have let God’s people go after Moses dropped his staff and it became a snake. Now, between 2-3 million people - all of Egypt’s construction workers, plumbers, infrastructure operators, got up and fled for their lives. 25% of the entire population of Egypt was walking out. Imagine what that would do to the United States if 25% of our manual laborers, construction crews, etc. just left the job- never to return. This is the equivalent of the population of the entire state of Oregon leaving Egypt. They took with them all their livestock, all their possessions, and some short-term food and water. The entire known world would have heard about it within days and were probably wondering where they were going. One thing was for sure, wherever they decided to go, life for the people in Egypt and in that land that they were going to, would never be the same. 

But the Egyptians were stubborn. They wanted their slaves. So they not only lost their workers, but they suffered all of the plagues before. Just think back to what happened to these people in the last year. 

Verse 38: `“A ____ multitude also went up with them.”` This could also be translated, “a huge ethnically diverse group also went up with them.” These Egyptian people had witnessed the miraculous work of _Yhwh_ and had been convinced to follow Him. 

Let me give you some food for thought. The _Lord_, _Yhwh_, killed the firstborns. That night, little babies, toddlers, teenagers, adults, the elderly…if they were the firstborn and not covered by the blood, they stopped breathing and died. Can you imagine the panic? Hundreds of thousands of livestock lay dead in the pastures. This would mean starvation for the Egyptians. God was unstoppable and unapologetic when He brought judgment. There was no escape, but for the blood of the lamb. This is a sobering thought. 

If you do not have the blood of The Lamb sprinkled on your heart, eternal death is the result. There is no alternative, no neutrality, and no escape. These are God’s rules. Man’s rules mean nothing. 

Remember, at the very moment that _Yhwh_ was passing the death sentence on all of the firstborn of Egypt, He was delivering Israel. Egypt was frozen in fear in a national state of mourning, but in Israel there was feasting, worshipping and rejoicing! 

And in Exodus 12:15-20 God has some more instructions. For all future Passovers, there will be no leavened bread for seven days. The penalty was quite severe…the offending person would be _Cut Off_ (כָּרַת)<sup>[H3772](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3772/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H3772")</sup> (vs. 19). This word _Cut Off_ didn’t mean a time-out, or a spanking. This was the equivalent of cutting down a tree or removing a body part. It meant _Permanent Separation_. The banished person was banished from Israel. _Yhwh_ was doing the talking here. This rule did not only apply to Israelites. It also applied to any foreigner, any non-Israelite, any Egyptian that was with them, everyone. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>What rule did the _Lord_ give in verse 43 to Moses and Aaron? 

&nbsp;

Why? Well, simply, if you partake of the Passover, it is an outward sign that you are under the covenant of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. And it testifies that you believe by faith in the shed blood of the lamb that was sacrificed. If you don’t believe and you’re not under the covenant, God says you cannot eat it. 

Interesting, because when Paul writes about taking communion in the Lord’s Supper, he basically says the same thing. 1 Corinthians 11:29, `“For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves”`. That word _Judgment_ (κρίμα)<sup>[G2917](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2917/kjv/tr/0-1/ "Strong's Number G2917")</sup> can be translated into _Damnation_, _Condemnation_, or _Punishment_. That’s some strong language. If you’re not a believer and you take the elements of communion, you’re taking the elements of a covenant that you are not a part of. What you are doing is heaping more condemnation on yourself by spotlighting your own sin: mocking the cross by not believing in the cross yourself. That’s serious. 

Mark Exodus 12:50-51 in your Bible. This is the exodus! They are exiting the land. This one moment in time commemorated past deliverance and predicted future deliverance. There was not one day more or less after the death of the firstborn when they would escape their captors. The first available day for them to depart was when they did! This is the birth of a new nation. The labor pains are over! Israel kept the commandments of God that Moses delivered. Their faith and obedience saved their firstborn, plundered the Egyptians, and set them free from Egypt! 

God already had them in military divisions (verse 51). They had not fought one battle. From a human standpoint they should not have been a match for the Egyptian army. Yet, God called them His army. But then again, if God is the head of the army, how powerful does it need to be? (I suppose we’ll find out in Revelation!).

&nbsp;

A lamb changed the lives of the Israelites. They were slaves, and now they are free. They were in bondage, and now they are released. And that principal will still be the same when the perfect Lamb of God frees us from our own bondage.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Study Question 3** </span><br/><br/>What do you think the Israelites did the minute they realized they were free? What physical responses do you imagine they had to their freedom?

&nbsp;

We sing songs in church like, “I’m no longer a slave to sin,” and “He set me free.” And some people sing like they are still enslaved. There is no joy. There should be joy overflowing when you think that we were lost, but now are found. I have a challenge for you: When you worship this Sunday, listen to the lyrics. Set them in your heart and let yourself respond to those words in a new way. Maybe you have never lifted your hands in worship. Maybe you just need to take a moment and thank God for salvation and deliverance. It might look boisterous and joyous, or your thoughts may be private and introspective. But take a moment to really feel the words. Let God speak to you in a new way.
