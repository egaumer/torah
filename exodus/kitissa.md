# _Ki Tissa_ &sdot; כי תשא
Parashah 21 &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; _When you take (_ 30:11&mdash;34:35 _)_

The twenty-first reading from the Torah is _Ki Tisa_, which literally means _When You Lift Up_. It comes from the first words of the second verse of the reading (Exodus 30:12). The majority of this parsha is concerned with the sin of the golden calf and how Moses undertakes to restore the covenant relationship

# Day 1 &middot; _Census, Oil, and Incense_

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 30:11-16

Moses has been instructed to take a census of the people. And there is a special way of taking the census. The people of Israel were to each contribute a half-shekel coin. The census taker could tally the number of coins to arrive at the sum total of the people. 

The coins provide a way to avoid numbering people off. Why doesn’t God want His people to be counted by means of assigning a number? For the same reason you don't like it when you get caught up in government bureaucracy and felt dehumanized by being treated as only a number. People are not numbers. If we want to see the world with God's eyes, we need to learn to see people as individuals. Each one is precious; each one is unique and of great value. 

After the half-shekels were collected and counted, they were used for the service of the Tabernacle. A shekel equals 1/5 of an ounce of silver. As of today, silver is worth $24.17 an ounce. A full shekel would be $4.84. So a half-shekel would be about $2.40. This would not be a burden on the people. Verse 15 specifically says that the rich are not to give more, and the poor are not to give less. It is equal. God paid the price of Jesus as the ransom and whether we are a king or slave, rich or poor, male or female, the price is the same. There are no extras and no substitutes. 

The coins would be used to form the sockets for the posts of the sanctuary. This was a one-time happening, although later in the Torah there was a permanent ordinance. But like all things, beyond the use of the money, there was a spiritual purpose for it.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>What is the reason (verse 12) that they are paying the 1/2 shekel? &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;. This idea of being ransomed is at the heart of God’s plan of salvation. A random paid is what redeems us. We sing songs like, “I've been redeemed, by the blood of the Lamb” and “Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.” But do we really understand it? 

&nbsp;

_Yhwh_ set up a system where every father had to pay the priesthood a set amount of money to redeem the life of their firstborn male child. In addition, there was another kind of redemption that involved a kinsman redeemer. (This is a relative who redeems the property or life of a family member who had fallen into debt and would lose their property, be sold as a slave…or both.)

Here’s the bottom line principle. We are born in debt to God. He created us. He formed us in the womb. He owns us. We are the debtors; He is the creditor. As descendants of Adam and Eve, we were born as sinners and by all rights should be destroyed. Redemption is not free. It always costs. Somebody pays. But it wasn’t the infant firstborn who was to pay; it was the father. And only a relative had the right to perform the kinsman redemption. This system is a shadow and pattern of what is to come. 

God is making it clear to Israel (and then every nation) that we all need to be redeemed. The world needs to understand that God’s principle is that our lives, our eternal lives, need to be redeemed. And the simple fact is that if our eternal lives are not redeemed, then we suffer eternal death. Jesus, God’s firstborn Son, was given as the redemption price (the ransom) for the redemption of His firstborn nation, Israel. 

The census in Exodus was ordered because Israel was God’s firstborn nation among all the nations of the world, and just like the firstborn son of the family, it had to be redeemed. This practice let the people understand that they indeed belong to God. They were His. He owned them. And it showed that Israel was set apart, made holy, to _Yhwh_.

&nbsp;

The bronze laver is a large basin with water. It is used for the priests to wash. It was a symbol of purification. Interestingly enough, there are no specifications about how big the laver is. No dimensions are given. By the time we get to the temple being built under King Solomon, in 1 Kings 7 he goes nuts. He builds this enormous, several thousand gallon laver that sits on 12 pedestal oxen. It's massive! I would imagine with all the washing that the priests did, the water could get pretty dirty- especially being in the middle of a dusty desert, and with blood sacrifices.

The bronze part of this laver is interesting. We are told in chapter 38 that the women gathered their bronze mirror to make the laver. Perhaps God is more interested in purity than vanity…

In Revelation we see an Altar of Incense (Revelation 8) and in Revelation 4-5 we have seven lighted lamps before the throne of God. And we also see a laver in heaven. But it's not liquid.

John describes it in Revelation 4:6 `“Also in front of the throne there was what looked like a ____ of ____, clear as crystal.”`

Why is it liquid in the Old Testament and the New Testament Temple, but in heaven it's solid? It’s clear because in heaven, there is no need for cleansing from sin.

&nbsp;

Just check out the quantity of ingredients! We saw that a shekel is a monetary unit, but it is also a weight measurement. Let's put this recipe into terms we can understand: 

* 13.75 pounds of liquid myrrh (6.25 kilograms or 6250 milliliters)
* 6.88 pounds of cinnamon (3.125 kilograms or 3125 grams)
* 6.88 pounds of calamus (3.125 kilograms or 3125 grams)
* 13.75 pounds of cassia (6.25 kilograms or 6250 milliliters)
* 0.98 gallons of olive oil (3.7 liters)

These spices and oils would be blended by a specialist and were used to consecrate people (and implements) to divine service. It was only used for the priesthood and could be used on nothing else.

The incense was made by a perfumer and would be burned on the altar of incense. Do some research on these and take notes in your workbook. 

Balsam is a tree and the ingredient was the sap. It is a shrub found in southeast Egypt. It is also called the “balm of Gilead.” Historically 
balsam was used for burns, sores, cuts, tumors, heart and chest pains, cancer, inflammation, colds, coughs, warts, wounds and as a pain reliever. It is also used in medicine for its antiseptic, anti inflammatory, and pain-relieving properties.

An onycha is a snail-like mollusk found in the Red Sea. It is known for its comforting and soothing properties as well as benefits for the skin. Ancient people used it to improve complexion and to help nourish the skin.

Galbanum oil is distilled from the resin of this flowering plant from Persia. (It is beneficial for aging skin, improves skin tone and reduces muscle spasms. It is particularly effective in curing muscular and nervous disorders, including respiratory and gastrointestinal spasms. Additionally, it helps detoxify the body and promotes healing.

Last, but not least is frankincense. Mention this fragrance and it's hard not to think about Christmas. It was once more valuable than gold. Frankincense 
is used for many things: aging skin, wound healing, improved respiratory function, improved arthritis and digestion and reduces asthma, stress levels, and induces relaxation. It is known for its anti inflammatory and antibacterial properties. It can even help fight certain types of cancer!

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 31

&nbsp;

This is one of my favorite parts of this book. (I think I've said that a few times, but they are all my favorite parts!). So far in this story we’ve met people like Moses, Aaron, Miriam, and Pharaoh (boo). But in this chapter, we’re going to meet a really cool guy! His name is Bazalel and God ordains and anoints him because he is gifted in the work of art! God is going to supernaturally gift him to do what he loves to do for God's glory in the Tabernacle. Isn’t that just the greatest thing?!

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 2 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>What do you like to do? How could you do for God’s glory? 

&nbsp;

I ask that because we often have a wrong idea of what real ministry is. We think of ministry being the pastor, but there are SO many different ways you can be in ministry. You begin with what you are talented in. What has God gifted you with? I am a Certified CliftonStrengths Coach and I speak and coach people all the time on how to leverage their talents and strengths.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 2 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>f you have ever taken the CliftonStrengths® Assessment, what are your Top 5 Strengths? My Top 5 are: Achiever, Learner, Focus, Positivity and WOO. 

&nbsp;

Those talents are what God has already equipped you with! You don't need to look any further! Your ministry will start with a desire.

```
“Take ____ in the LORD, and He will give you the ____ of your heart.” - (Psalm 37:4 NIV)
```

He’s not going to give you every thing your heart desires. God is not a vending machine or a genie in a bottle. But He will give you the desire itself! He’ll give you the desire so that you will want what He wants. We should all pray for that! 

A few years ago I had the desire to write a book. I had been asked to write a book for years, but pushed it out of my head. I'm not a writer, I'm a reader! God gifted me with the desire to learn! But do you realize that the flip-side of learning is teaching? What's the flip-side of reading…it's writing. Who knew?! God gave me the desire to learn and get information so I could teach it. It's probably why I love teaching students so much. I get to learn right along with them. In my class, we all learn together. It's the best way! Then when an “a-ha” moment comes along, it hits us all! 

Bezalel was already a skilled craftsman. There was a natural ability and he probably really loved to make stuff with his hands. I'm sure his friends and family all confirmed his skill and talent. Now comes a supernatural calling and empowering! Because (here's the principle) If God calls you, He’ll enable you. 

If you join the armed forces, the Marines won’t say, “Well, we're so happy to have you as a Marine. Now you have to buy your own gun and tank.” That’s not how it works. You get equipped and trained. And it is the same way in the body of Christ. If God calls you to be a pastor, He’ll give you the gift of teaching. If God calls you to be an evangelist, He'll equip you with the ability to make friends with strangers and will instill in you the ability to reach into someone’s heart by your words and lead them to Christ.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 2 &#8729; Study Question 3** </span><br/><br/>What types of skills was Bezalel gifted in (_Verses 4-5_)?

&nbsp;

Hmmm… did you catch that in verse 5? “To cut and set stones, to work in wood”... Did you know that Jesus was a carpenter. In those days the job of a carpenter was to plan and build homes, manufacture household furniture and construct farming tools. Jesus would have learned to work with stone and wood from His earthly father, Joseph.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 2 &#8729; Study Question 4** </span><br/><br/>Then in _Verse 6_, God appoints Oholiab to help him! What things will Bezalel, Oholiab, and their team build in _Verses 7-11_? 

&nbsp;

That’s definitely going to take some supernatural power! That is a LOT of different skill sets! 

Here's something that I don't want you to miss: In verse 2: “I have chosen”, verse 3: “I have filled him”, verse 6: “I have appointed” and “I have given ability.” God called these two by name! His calling comes with an anointing and enabling. This is not something they have to manufacture, it is something that God is doing. 

This team is going to work together to do some amazing things for God. Look, when you want to go on vacation, you may fly to Hawaii. How did you get there? Yes, the pilot takes you, but so does the stewardess, air traffic controller, the ticket agent, ground crew, TSA… do you see what I’m saying? It takes a team. When you come to church on Sunday, it’s not just the pastor who is in the ministry. It’s the ushers, the Sunday school teacher, the sound men, the worship team, the greeters…it takes a team to do God's work. And God will equip every one of them in a special way, with special talents and skill sets to get His work accomplished. 

All this talk of working is making me tired. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 31:12-18 

&nbsp;

Ahh, just in time… the Sabbath! God just gave Bezalel and Oholiab a grand list of tasks to do. And on the heels of that, He reminds them to rest. I need God to make me rest sometimes. Don't you? When your plate is full and there are more things to do than you have time, the very LAST thing I am thinking of is stopping. 

Why? Why God? Why did you give us so many things to do and then tell us to stop? Maybe God is saying, “Yep, I gave you a big task, but you are not exempt from keeping the Sabbath.” 

Verse 13: ‘This will be a &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; between me and you for the generations to come, so you may &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; that I am the LORD, who makes you &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;.” 

God equipped them. It is the LORD who gave them the desire and the talents. It is the LORD who makes them holy. And because He gave the gift, He can also take it away. God is commanding a vacation every week. And we complain about that. We actually argue with God about how busy we are, how many activities we have our kids in, how much shopping needs to get done. And God just says, “rest.” 

This chapter concludes the 40 days and nights Moses spent on Mount Sinai with Yahweh. He's gotten the law, the commandments, the blue prints to the tabernacle, the recipes, the specification, the measurements… He’s spent quality time with God. He's energized and ready to start work. So he starts down the mountain ready to talk to the people about his amazing experience and what God has in store for them! Oh boy! They are going to be so happy!

&nbsp;

Every day you could probably give a different answer, but what is it today? Smiling, tolerant, loving, grandfather in the sky, mystical, aloof, distant? Why is it important how you picture God? Because metal images are a consequence of mental images. The Israelites were tired of waiting for Moses. He had been gone for a month and ten days. They want a visual reminder of God. 

If you look back, you can see the faithfulness of God in action. God delivers the Israelites out of Egypt. Check. They cross The Red Sea, check. A pillar of cloud and a pillar of fire are the divine GPS system, check. Mosts goes up and gets the Ten Commandments, check. Everything is looking really good! Moses goes back up the mountain and gets the blueprints for the tabernacle. The priesthood is created. All good stuff! Then there’s chapter 32. (Is there a chapter 32 in your life? Read on.)

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span>  Exodus 32:1-6 

&nbsp;

We’re going to spend today just looking at this small section.

Let's just pause and look at this scene from God's perspective. Moses has spent 40 days and nights learning from Yahweh on the mountain. He has in his hands the Ten Commandments and is on a spiritual high. But back on the ranch, there's trouble a-brewin’.

But this covenant had stipulations. Israel had obligations to make, and consequences if they didn't make those. (Just chapters 21-22 have 46 “if” clauses.) In Exodus 23:22, God sends an angel to prepare the way for them. `“____ you listen carefully to what he says &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; do all that ____ say, I will be an enemy to your enemies and will oppose those who oppose you.”` Then in verse 24 he tells them not to bow down to their gods.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 3 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>What are the things that Israel need to do in order to fulfill their part of the covenant? (Exodus 20:21-33)

&nbsp;


God sees Israel's building of a calf as adultery. (Wait. What? Adultery?) Yep- They were supposed to be in union with Him, but they brought another god into the picture. This is really what makes the Bible so remarkable. These are God’s people. They are set apart. So why not paint them as saints instead of sinners? Make Israel the shining hero. But the Bible shows us our human condition. We are fickle and selfish, and impatient. 

Let's reverse a bit. Let's try something. Go to biblegateway.com and enter the passage of Exodus 20. Pick any translation you like and so a search for the word “gods”. You can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+f (Windows, Chrome or Mac) to find a word or phrase quickly. How many times does it mention the word “gods?”

There are two verses that mention gods: Exodus 20:3 `“You shall have no other gods before me”` (This is literally the second thing God spoke to them in His audible voice)” and Exodus 20:23 `“Do not make any gods to be alongside me; do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold"`. How interesting that _Yhwh_ specifies in verse 23 not to make gods of gold. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 3 &#8729; Study Question 3** </span><br/><br/>In Exodus 20:22 Moses begins speaking for the LORD and he continues through to Exodus 24:3. What did the people promise in Exodus 24:3?

&nbsp;

If I were a filmmaker, I would shift the scene from this divine encounter of Moses to a quick pan down the valley to the people. There are two ways you can view God in this scene:

1. Revelation by God revealing Himself in the mountaintop experience. This is where you get to know God, hear His heart, understand what He loves and what He hates. He will show you the plan for your life based on God’s Word here.
2. Imagination- making stuff up as you go along. This is where most of the world is. The problem with every mountaintop experience is you have to eventually come down. 

In Matthew 17:1-3 , Jesus took Peter, James and John up a high mountain. And there, Jesus was transfigured before them! And who else appeared with him (vs 3)?

Wow, what a fantastic experience! But when they came down the mountain in _Verses 14-20_, what did they encounter?

Moses comes down the mountain to a camp of Israelites that has let idolatry run rampant. (What is an idol? An idol is anything in your life that takes the place of God, anything that you let divert your attention away from knowing and worshipping God.)

Why a golden calf? The golden calf was a common animal image used by almost every Middle Eastern culture. In Egypt it was called the Apis bull. They needed a visual representation of something to worship. The cultures all around them worshiped bulls. Baal was the god of that area. They immediately latched on to the local gods and give that god the credit of bringing them out of Egypt. What happened to their memories? 

They had heard God's own voice tell them the Ten Commandments. But at the first sign of God being silent their instinct was to not believe God, not trust God, not be obedient to God, but to behave as they always had. Had worshipping the Egyptian gods ever saved them or freed them? No!~ They were slaves until God rescued them. But it didn't matter. They just turned back to what was familiar and shut their eyes to what was right. How many times have we done the same thing? We love the things that validate the lifestyle we've chosen. We will compromise God's word in a heartbeat if doing so satisfies our emotions or wants. We have to fight daily to know truth. 

It’s been 40 days and the people have not seen, nor heard from Yahweh. Isaiah 45:15 says, `“Truly you are a God who has been ____ Himself, the God and Savior of Israel.”`

```
“For we live by ____, not by ____.” - (2 Corinthians 5:7 NIV)
``` 

The Israelites are learning to walk by faith. How are they doing so far? 

Exodus 32:4 … `”Then they said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.’”` They said? How interesting that the mouthpiece of Moses is silent. He asks for the gold, then they they do all the speaking. Aaron asks them for gold earrings. He’s not asking a lot - just earrings. But with those earrings he is able to fashion an idol. Aaron fashions it with a tool. He is very involved. 

I think Aaron caught a glimpse of how horrible this was because he announces in _Verse 5_, `“Tomorrow there will be a festival to the LORD.”` To _yhwh_?! I think he was feeling guilty. He knew something was wrong, but at this point, he started something and could not put it back to rights. It's like squeezing all of the toothpaste out and trying to get it back in. Ever been there? The people weren’t worshipping an entirely different god. They were making an image of the God of Israel, _Yhwh_, with a calf!

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 3 &#8729; Study Question 4** </span><br/><br/>What images and icons do we use to represent God? What is our rationale? ___ Oh man, there are a lot of lessons here, but I’m just going to let that one sit with you a while.

&nbsp;

In _Verse 6_ it says that the next day after the calf was make they got up, sacrificed burnt offerings, fellowship offerings, ate and drank and got up to indulge in _Revelry_. The King James says to _Play_. The Hebrew word is _Sahaq_ (צָחַק) <sup>[H6711](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6711/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H6711")</sup>. It means to _Laugh_, _Mock_, or _Make Sport of_. They are not just celebrating, they are mocking _Yhwh_. My stomach hurts just thinking about this. 

This week (you can’t make this stuff up), the Dodgers hosted drag nuns called "The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence” at one of their games. This was the same kind of blasphemous activity that was going on with the Israelites. 

It’s really hard for people to wait. We must “wait, wait, wait on the Lord,” but we “hate, hate, hate” doing it! The Bible says those that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength. Can you imagine the blessing they would have received had the people been able to wait a little longer? The longer we have to wait on the Lord, the more our belief system can fall apart. 

There is a parallel between the golden calf and the tabernacle. They are both intended to satisfy man’s need of proof of God’s presence. The calf was an anti-tabernacle. It was a perverse man-made idea. It was made sincerely, but sincerely wrong. The tabernacle was a God-ordained heavenly model. And it would come in God's timing, not man’s.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 3 &#8729; Study Question 5** </span><br/><br/>God-ordained vs man-ordained. How many examples in our current culture can you list?

&nbsp;

This event is going to become a stain on the Israelites for generations to come. When the story of [Passover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover) is told, this will also be told. Read Psalm 106:19-23 and Acts 7:40-41. We have to be careful how we handle what God commands. 

Here is a scary thought. Our world is crying out for someone to build a golden calf. We have a lot of fears: worldwide financial collapse, plagues, wars and rumors of wars. Very soon the “church” (and I use that term lightly because to the outside world, it will seem legitimate) will join the effort of the world and install an end time golden calf, the Antichrist. 

And as in Moses' time, it will occur as God is in the process of displaying His true presence in the form of Jesus’ second coming. It will be in God's timing, not man’s. And according to Romans 9:27, only a remnant will be saved. (Read all of Romans 9.:6-29.)

# Day 4 &middot; _De-Calf Latte_

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 32:7-35

&nbsp;

While Moses is coming down the mountain, God gives him a quick “heads up.” Exodus 32:7 `"Go down, because ___ people, whom ___ brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt.”` Can you hear the sarcasm in God’s voice?

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>The people of Israel depended on Moses as mediator. When he had not come down the mountain they did what humans do when leadership is gone: they panic and anarchy reigns. The result here, was a golden calf. It’s not a good idea to make a decision when you are panicked. That's why God reminds us so often to “fear not.” Fear leads to poor judgment and irrational behavior. I will not have you write it down, but I’m pretty sure you can name a lot of bad decisions (in yourself or others) that were made in distressed times. Can you think of any examples of people panicking when Godly leadership is not available? 

Then God makes Moses an offer. 

```
“I have seen ___ people," the LORD said to Moses, “and they are a ____-____ people. Now leave me ____ so that my ____ may burn against them and that I may ____ them. Then I will make ____ into a great nation.” - (Exodus 32:9 NIV)
```

God is justifiably angry. He has a plan He just rescued them from slavery and provided for them week after week with everything they needed. He brought them to Mount Sinai and showed them his power and glory. He gave them the law and has been very clear on his expectations. One month goes by and they’ve lost their minds! God is basically offering to Moses the promise He made to Abraham. Wow! Read Moses' reply Exodus 32:11-13. Moses doesn't jump on board with this new idea (I might be tempted to take that offer)- he takes this opportunity to intercede (good choice, Moses!). He thinks of God's reputation. He calls on God to relent. To go in another direction and not destroy them. God's promises, character and reputation are at stake. 

God relenting bothers a lot of people. 

```
"God is not ___, that He should ___, not a human being, that He should ___ His mind." - (Numbers 23:19 NIV)
``` 

This is an example of [anthropomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism). (Use that word this week and you'll definitely get street cred!) Anthropomorphism is simply a literary device that is expressing in human language a divine response. God is outside our time and space continuum. The only way humans are going to understand God is to have Him somewhat expressed in human terms. `“The eyes of the Lord go to and fro throughout the earth”` - that's anthropomorphism. Ezra gives an example of this when he says, `“The hand of God was upon me"` and when David said, `“I hide under the shadow of the Lord's wings”`. 

God isn't a chicken. This is just a way for us to understand God in human terms. God is in teaching mode, “Torah-mode.” He is showing Moses just how serious disobedience to the Almighty was. God never does things that are out of His nature. He does not change His mind. He does not change, period. God says this to Moses to get him on his knees to pray for His people. This is a good reminder for us when we see things happening in our country that we think are judgment…maybe it’s God giving us an opportunity to intercede. Just a thought. 

He meets Joshua part way down the mountain. Joshua is like the assistant pastor! It's important for us to see that Joshua was in no way connected with the golden calf. He was on the mountain with Moses. He had nothing to do with the idolatry. Joshua is a military-minded man. So when Joshua hears a noise in the camp, he assumes it’s a sound of war. The first thing Joshua thinks of is being a soldier. But Moses says, “No. That's not the sound of war… that’s the sound of worship.” 

Can you just imagine Moses’ heart when he turns the corner and sees them for the first time- dancing around the calf and mocking _Yhwh_? Moses was HOT! He immediately took the tablets, that Yahweh wrote on, and smashed them to pieces. Exodus 32:20 `“And he took the ___ that the people had made and ___ it in the fire; then he ground it to ___, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites ___ it.”`

Why did Moses break the tablets? The act of breaking the tablets is significant. In the Middle East, whenever a covenant was made, written down, and then violated, the clay tablet it was written on was ceremonially thrown down to signify that the covenant was broken. I imagine it broke Moses’ heart (more than it angered him) to break the covenant tablets. 

Now Moses is mad! It's hardcore to make the Israelites drink a “de-calf latte”! Did it make them sick to their stomachs? I'm sure Moses hoped so! Yes, be sick of your sin! 

Then Moses turns his anger to Aaron. “What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?”

Aaron’s answer is classic. We just have to read it again. 

```
“‘Do not be angry, my lord,’ Aaron answered. ‘You know how prone these people are to ___. They said to me, ’Make us gods who will go before us. As for this ___ Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don’t know what happened to him.’” - (Exodus 32:22-23 NIV)
```

This “fellow Moses”?! Oh, you mean Aaron’s BROTHER?! The one _Yhwh_ chose to lead this group? That fellow?

Verse 24 `“So I told them, ‘Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.' Then they gave me the gold, and I ___ it into the fire, and ___ ___ this calf!’”` Oh my! That’s hysterical. I wonder if after he said it, Aaron knew how ridiculous he sounded.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>It was peer pressure. When confronted with the question, “Should I please God or my friends?” Aaron chose badly. If it wasn’t so sad, it would be hysterical! OK, it is hysterical! Seriously Aaron, what a lame excuse! Don't take any responsibility- It’s not my fault, it’s the people. How sad. Always the victim, it's not my fault, it’s the fault of my circumstances. Ever heard that excuse? Ever made it yourself? (Ouch…that stung a little.)

&nbsp;

Now Moses throws down a gauntlet. He does something that God has demonstrated since the beginning of time when He separated darkness from light. He divides and separates the Israelites to create unity. “Unity at any cost” is not biblical. Mostly because it's too simplistic. All throughout scripture you are going to see God divide, elect and separate as a way of achieving real unity. Sadly, the church, and the world, have fallen into the warped belief that unity is compromise. God's unity has nothing to do with consensus, conformity, and definitely not compromise. Unity is a oneness with His spirit. 

Immediately the Levites did what Moses had said and killed about 3,000 people. These people were not backing down from their idol worship, they wouldn't give it up. Because they were bent on it and unrestrained, God dealt harshly with them. (They should have known better, after all, they saw with their own eyes how God dealt with Pharaoh’s hard heart.)

But why kill the people? When a Doctor tells you “There is a tumor and we are going to operate in two days,” that means it's bad. But why surgery? Don't cut anything out of my body…it will hurt. They cut it out to save your life. God is doing that now, He is cutting out this tumor. This cancerous people could have prevented the entire group from entering the Promised Land. It happened quickly. Sin happened quickly. This is why it's so important for us to encourage one another daily. 

Genesis 49:5-7. Jacob is on his deathbed and is prophesying over his sons Simeon and Levi. Right here, the Levites are divided from the rest of Israel. Their righteous anger will kill many calf-worshippers, including their own children. The overall fate of the Levites would not change from Jacob's prophecy, but the nature in how it would manifest did. They will end up being the tribe that is in charge of all sacrifices. 

Exodus 32:32 `“But now, please ___ their sin, but if not, then ___ me out of the ___ you have written.”` Hold up. Is that possible? To be blotted out of God's book? You’re going to have to wait till tomorrow to find out!

# Day 5 &middot; _The Turn-Around_

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 32:7-35

&nbsp;

We ended yesterday with the question, Is it possible to be blotted out of God's book? This may not be what you think. In Exodus 30, God told Moses to take a census. It is a record of all the living Israelites. 

In Psalm 69:28 David is venting to God about his enemies. He says, `“May they be blotted out of the book of life and not be listed with the righteous”`. Think of it this way- when you die, your name will be taken out of the book of the living. 

The “book” Moses is talking about here is most likely the census of the living. But here's the interesting thing. Moses’ life has dramatically changed since he's been on the mountain. When he started his adventure with God he was trying to do anything but be in the ministry. He went from, "Lord, send someone else,: to now, "Lord, forgive them. And if you won’t forgive them and are going to kill them, you might as well kill me, too...because these are my people. I choose to suffer with them.” Wow. Now, that's a turn-around! 

This sounds an awful lot like Paul when he writes in Romans 9:1-4 “I speak the truth in Christ- I am not lying, my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit- I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were cursed and &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; from Christ for the sake of my people, those of my own race, the people of Israel.”

Do you think Paul was referring to Moses when He said this? Could be! 

Then God sends an angel and punishes the people with a plague for worshipping an idol. We see both God's grace and God's government. In His grace, He forgave them. In His government, He punishes their sin. Hebrews 12:6 says, `“The Lord ____ the one he ___.”`

All of this is because the Israelites could not see God and needed a visual representation in order to worship. Here’s a news flash, we can’t see God. I know, shocking, huh? But that’s not the point. The point isn’t that we can’t see God it's that God can see us! Read Psalm 139:7-10. God is everywhere and He sees you no matter where you go. You can't run from Him.

&nbsp;

God directs Moses to leave this place. In _Verse 3_ He says, `“Go up to the land flowing with __ and ___. But ___ ___ ___ ___ with you, because you are a stiff-necked people and I might destroy you on the way.”` When the Israelites heard this they began to mourn. That word means they were wailing and lamenting as if someone died. It’s deep in their soul.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>What did they do in verse 6?

&nbsp;

The ornaments they wore were from Egypt. They were pagan ornaments. This is not the worship Yahweh wanted, and they knew it. They took off the symbols of false worship and stood before the Lord, humbled, sorry, and with a contrite heart. 

Put yourself in Moses’ place for a moment. He had to deliver this message. In the past, he didn't want to tell Pharaoh to “Let my people go.” But here, he is telling the people, “You messed up, big time. Repent!” Sometimes pastors have to deliver hard messages. It’s not about picking and choosing only the “feel-good” passages in Scripture. People need to hear the whole truth. And sometimes it hurts, and makes us mourn for our sins. 

Go back and read _Verse 21_ again. Some people think that this is a perfect example of the vengeful and wrath-filled God of the Old Testament. He’s going to send an angel because he might destroy them. That would be a mistake. This is a gracious and loving God who is still preparing a way for His people, despite their actions. God’s holiness is so great, it cannot be around sin.

Remember Raiders of the Lost Ark when the Nazis opened up the Ark of the Covenant? God’s power was so strong, it melted them. (If you haven’t see in, do a Google search for [Raiders of the Lost Ark Movie clip- face melting](https://www.google.com/search?q=Raiders+of+the+Lost+Ark+Movie+clip-+face+melting&sxsrf=AB5stBgep_qsdSopyJ0VMuEfCknPP8tbgg%3A1690920510494&source=hp&ei=PmbJZIW6G7vakPIPoeWqiAk&iflsig=AD69kcEAAAAAZMl0TthjwUqQD90iyaUpBF73PRlZibRS&ved=0ahUKEwiF0fniobyAAxU7LUQIHaGyCpEQ4dUDCAw&uact=5&oq=Raiders+of+the+Lost+Ark+Movie+clip-+face+melting&gs_lp=Egdnd3Mtd2l6IjBSYWlkZXJzIG9mIHRoZSBMb3N0IEFyayBNb3ZpZSBjbGlwLSBmYWNlIG1lbHRpbmcyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigAUiIFlCKBVj2E3ABeACQAQCYAXigAe8BqgEDMC4yuAEDyAEA-AEC-AEBqAIKwgIHECMY6gIYJw&sclient=gws-wiz)) Sheesh, if I had the choice of being melted or just giving up my ornaments, I'd choose drop-the-earrings at once! 

We can have 3 responses to our sin. 

1. We can compare ourselves to others, like the Pharisees did and think, “Well, at least I’m not as bad as that guy over 
there.” 
2. You can acknowledge your sin and decide to fix it yourself. Maybe you get a good self-help book, or talk to a friend. 
3. You can mourn over your sin, drop the things that are holding you back and follow the Lord

“The LORD would ___ to Moses ___ to ___, as one speaks to a ___.” - (Exodus 33:11 NIV)
``` 

I love Exodus 33:11! Isn’t that the sweetest?!

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>If you had to characterize how you speak to God, how would you describe it?

&nbsp;

Some people relate to God like an emergency room doctor. "Help! It's urgent! Am I going to live?” Everything is a crisis. Some talk to God 
begrudgingly. It’s a chore you have to do. Some talk to God like they would a police officer- always explaining why they did something wrong. 

Then Moses talks to the LORD in Exodus 33:12-21. Moses asks God to give him leadership skill, relationship skills, and partnership skills. He 
wants God to (Exodus 33:13) `“___ me your ways so I may know you and continue to find favor with you."`

That should be our prayer. "God, teach me to be a better mom/dad, leader in my work/church/home. Remember the people around me and help me to deal with them. And LORD, help me to continue to find favor with you, to partner with you and seek you every day.”

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Study Question 3** </span><br/><br/>And how does the LORD reply in verse 14?

&nbsp;

God sees Moses. He knows him by name. Does God know you by name? Oh, I sure hope and pray that He does! 

```
Then Moses said, “Now ___ me your ___.” - (Exodus 33:18)
``` 

Moses has seen a lot in his life so far. With his own eyeballs, he saw the burning bush, he saw all of the plagues of Egypt, he saw the Red Sea part! 
But Moses wants more. The awesome thing about God is you can never have enough. Once God opens your eyes, you just want to see more. You won’t ever get to the place where you say, “OK, God. I've seen enough now. You can stop.” 

We sing a song in worship called, "Open the eyes of my heart.” I want to see you. I want to see your glory. There is something in the very heart of us 
that won't be happy until we see (with our own eyeballs) the glory of the LORD, face to face.
