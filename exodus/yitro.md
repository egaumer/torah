# _Yitro_ &sdot; יתרו
Parashah 17 &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; _Jethro (_ 18:1&mdash;20:23(26) _)_

The seventeenth reading from the Torah is named _Yitro_ (יִתְרוֹ)<sup>[H3503](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3503/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H3503")</sup>, which is the literal Hebrew name behind the name of Moses’ father-in-law, Jethro. The title comes from Exodus 18:1, `“Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people.”` This portion tells the story of Jethro’s visit to the camp of Israel, then relates the great story on Mount Sinai, where God gives Israel the Ten Commandments and invites the people to enter a special covenant relationship with Him. 

Each portion of the Torah is named for the first word appearing in the portion. The first major word in this verse is Jethro, so Jethro (or _Yitro_ in Hebrew) is the name of the portion. Jethro is one of three portions in the Torah named for non-Jews; the others were _Noah_ (who predated the Israelites) and _Balak_ (villainous king of Moab). Once again, we see that the Torah is not only a document concerned for Jews; it is concerned for all humanity.

# Day 1 &middot; _Jethro_

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 18

&nbsp;

Moses is a very strong leader. He’s aggressive. But up to this point he’s been doing it all by himself. He’s a one-man-show, pastoring almost 3 million people all on his own. Joshua fights all the battles. Moses does all the spiritual work. Fortunately, Moses has a father-in-law who is smart and sees what Moses is doing. Today’s lesson is a study of human nature and administration and delegation. 

Moses has been reunited with his wife, Zipporah and his two sons. I’m sure they all shared stories of what exciting things had happened in their absences of each other. And then Moses brings his father-in-law in on the unending problems of dealing with this enormous population or ungrateful people who loved to tell Moses how he was doing it all wrong. 

Imagine if you will, Moses and the people of Israel began their daily routine. The people began to line up at sunrise perhaps outside Moses’ tent to have their leader settle disputes and seek counsel. One would imagine that the line was long considering the nation had 2-3 million people…and Moses was the sole judge. And they were still standing at sunset. 

Moses’ whole day was taken up with this work. People were coming in droves. Moses was close to burnout. It was an important ministry to the spiritual health of the people. But at the end of the day, there still was a long line of weary Israelites. Enter Jethro. Jethro immediately sees that Moses is working himself to death. 

Jethro suggests a management team. When I wrote my book, “Heroes of the Faith” I put Jethro as the Strengths theme of Arranger. People who are especially talented in the Arranger theme can organize, but they have a flexibility that complements this ability. They like to figure out how all of the pieces and resources can be arranged for maximum productivity. Jethro sees that Moses is now “The Wilderness Warden”, well, that’s what we’ll call him. Despite Moses being raised in all the wisdom and education of Egypt, Jethro has most likely been Moses’ best teacher of what it means to be a leader. 

[Dwight L Moody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_L._Moody) put it this way, “I’d rather find 100 men to do the work than to do the work of 100 men.” 

Jethro’s solution for Moses is to work smarter, not harder, by organizing a ministry team. He needed to find men who feared God and had good character. These men would handle the smaller disputes, while Moses would still handle the bigger and more difficult disputes.

Moses was a hard worker. There is nothing wrong with that. But I’m sure his family was not too excited about his workload.

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Question 2** </span><br/><br/>Jethro's counsel to Moses allows him to focus on the most important matters and not bear the burden alone. How does Jesus, as the Messiah, invite us to cast our burdens on Him and find rest?

&nbsp;

Here’s something to think about: manage your life by what’s important, not only by what’s urgent. Set priorities and then do those things and don't worry about the other stuff. If everything in your life is “urgent” then how are you finding balance?

Remember the two sisters of Lazarus. They called for Jesus, “Our brother is sick. You need to come now.” Did Jesus come? No. He stayed two more days until Lazarus was dead. (But He should have been there. He was too late.) Jesus worked 3.5 years in public ministry. He cured many people, but there were still a lot of people he did not heal. How could Jesus say, “I’ve finished all the work which my Father gave me to do?” 

Because He lived on a schedule of God’s priorities. He managed his life according to what was important, not urgent. Yes, this is a hard pill to swallow. 
They set up their system similar to the Greco-Roman system (1000 years later) of having leaders of 10s, then leaders of 50s, then leaders of 100s, then leaders of 1,000s… Each group of leaders reported up to a higher group of leaders. 

Note: This system was not established by an Israelite. Jethro was a Midianite- a few years later, God would order Moses to destroy Midian, as they would become much like the Amalekites. This judiciary system was purely secular. It was not led by God’s set-apart servants: the Levites and priests. The Bible makes it clear that they are coming from “all the people” and not necessarily the elders. And one more thing: this secular judiciary was not ordained by the LORD. It was validated, but (note) Yahweh did not give Moses these instructions. What it did do for the people was give them a well organized command station for easily and rapidly spreading the Law when Yahweh gave it. 

Jethro encourages Moses to appoint capable leaders to assist him in governing the Israelites. We, too, should surround ourselves with people who are capable, strong, God-fearing, truthful and hating corruption. That’s good advice all around! 

_Yhwh_ is a God of order and structure, not of chaos and randomness. This is a God pattern, and we will see this pattern until Jesus comes, and then throughout eternity. 

If it were not for Jethro, Moses most likely would not have had the time to write the book of Exodus. We all have directly benefited from Jethro’s wise council to Moses. Chapter 18 is going to end with Moses as the final authority in matters, and Jethro leaving to return to his homeland, Midian. 

_Responding to Advice and Criticism_

Most people do not respond well to criticism. We can become easily offended in our culture. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Question 3** </span><br/><br/>When receiving advice or criticism, how do you know when to be offended and when to be thankful? That all depends on the intentions of the person giving the advice. Ask yourself: Does that person have your best interests at heart? Are they trying to hurt you in some way? Is the person honorable? How well do you know them? Do they have a history of having your back?

&nbsp;

Or, focus on the criticism and not the person. Does it seem valid? Sometimes you have to look past the animosity and to the advice. Maybe there is something you can learn here. 

Moses obviously trusted Jethro when he took his advice. Moses cared more about the Israelites than his own ego. We’ve all met the leader who does not only deny any criticism, but also forbids it. That is what we call a tyrant. 

&nbsp;
# Day 2 &middot; _Embracing God's Call_

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 19 

&nbsp;

In 1962 and 1963 the practice of organized prayer in US public schools was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. I don't know how long ago you were in school, or if you are currently a teacher, as I am. But I can say that since I started my formal education in 1972, and began teaching in 1990 there has been a definite decline in moral values, and deterioration of discipline. Have you noticed that? But fear not. I have also noted that as long as there are tests in school, students will continue to pray! I have an alarm set on my watch for 1:16PM every day. Karen Seddon inspired me to do this. Romans 1:16 says, `“For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.”` So every day at 1:16PM, when my alarm goes off, I say a silent prayer for whomever is standing in front of me. This could be a family member, student, parent, grocery store clerk, or a total stranger. 

More and more over the past years of our nation’s history, when God gets edged out, man’s ideas and opinions are put in place of it. When God’s laws are pushed aside, we lose the standard of truth. This leaves us without a moral compass. I can't even tell you how many times I hear students and staff say, “Do what you think is right for you at the time.” We’ve replaced truth with whatever is right in our own eyes. That’s a dangerous place to be. 

God is about to reveal His law to His people at Mount Sinai. And at the heart of this revelation is a very important word: covenant. A covenant is an agreement that governs a relationship. It could be a relationship between two cities, two people, tow nations, or a relationship between God and people. Covenant is very important to God. It's the reason the Israelites are free right now. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 2 &#8729; Question 1** </span><br/><br/>There are two types of covenants: unconditional and conditional. The covenant that God made with Abraham , Isaac and Jacob was unconditional. It had no conditions. God said, “I am going to give you and your descendants the land, the land of Israel, the land of Canaan as an everlasting possession.” That’s unconditional. However, the Mosaic covenant is a conditional covenant. The land they are to occupy is unconditional. Their tenure in the land and God’s blessing them in the land is conditional. So, what do you think will happen if God puts them into The Promised Land and they don’t obey God?

&nbsp;

1. He’s going to get the law 
2. He’s going to get a set of blueprints for the tabernacle. 

The law will facilitate the people’s obedience to God. The tabernacle will facilitate their worship to God. 

Obedience and worship: the two central expressions of their faith. This covenant the Lord made at Mount Sinai was fundamentally different from the Abrahamic covenant. The people of Israel had to obey, and God would respond depending on their behavior. Here are the terms: 

1. They were there not because of what they had done. God brought them out of Egypt. He redeemed them and carried them to this spot because he chose to do so. Exodus 19:4. 
2. If, and only if they will hear, accept, and follow the new covenant God is giving them will they become His own possession. God’s precious treasure. Exodus 19:5 `“Now _____ you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my _____ _____.”` 
3. If, and only if they follow this new covenant, will God consider them a kingdom of priests, a sanctified and 
holy group of people, set apart for service to God and relationship with God. Exodus 19:6.

God is giving them a conditional covenant. He is not saying, “I will, I will, I will. You just sit back and watch.” God is saying if you do this, then I will do that. There’s a principal behind this. How can you prove you love God? There has to be tangible proof. I hear people say all the time, "I love God.” How do you know? “Because I get a fuzzy feeling when I hear the word Jesus.” It has to be real and visible. It is evidenced by your obedience. Jesus said, “If you love me, you will keep my commandments.” Same principal.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 2 &#8729; Question 2** </span><br/><br/>Do a little research. In Exodus 19:5-6, God speaks of the Israelites being His treasured possession. What does it mean for God’s people to be treasured, and how does this concept apply to believers in Jesus Christ? (What 
research tools did you use?)

&nbsp;

They are going to be God’s treasured possession, a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. This calling to be set apart and dedicated to God will find its ultimate fulfillment in the Messiah. 1 Peter 2:9 says, `"But you are a ____, a royal ____, a holy ____, God’s special ____, that you may declare the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light.”` As the Israelites prepare to meet God, they consecrate themselves and cleanse their garments. The purification ritual not only cleanses their external actions, but also their hearts and souls.

If you look in your closet right now, I’m sure you have enough clean clothes to get you through a couple of days (some of you have much more), but not so in ancient times. The changing of their clothes and bathing was not a regular thing, especially in the wilderness. When one changed their clothes and bathed, it was a symbol of a new beginning. Later, the children of Israel would bathe before they worshipped the Lord in little pools called Mikvah. They would get ready, for on the third day, the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. 

If you have watched Season 3 of “The Chosen” you would have seen a mikvah in the show after Eden had miscarried. She went to a mikvah to be cleansed after she lost her baby. (If you haven’t seen Season 3, sorry about the spoiler alert… but you’ll know what she’s doing!)

```
“On the morning of the 3rd day there was ______ and ______, with a thick ______ over the mountain, and a very loud _______ blast. Everyone in the camp ______.” - (NIV Exodus 19:16)

 &nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 2 &#8729; Question 3** </span><br/><br/>Describe the dramatic scene of God’s descent on Mount Sinai in Exodus 19:16-19. How do these manifestations reflect God’s power and holiness? What would you be thinking if you were there?

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 2 &#8729; Question 4** </span><br/><br/>The mountain is enveloped in thunder, lightning’s and a thick cloud. The blast of the trumpet grows louder, and the people tremble. How does this scene foreshadow the arrival of the Messiah, and Christ’s future return? 

&nbsp;

God's instructions were wash your clothes, and watch your step. Don’t come too close. Got is setting parameters and restrictions so they don’t die because God’s power is going to be revealed from the mountain top to mankind. God, out of love, puts up restrictions. Just like any good parent would give their child restrictions to protect them. Imagine thunder, lightning, a thick cloud, the sound of a trumpet, and an earthquake. This was not a beautiful sight.
It was scary. 

The people have just cleansed themselves and built an extensive wall so the sheep and goats could not jump over it. They are now at the foot of the mountain. They are expectant, and perhaps a little nervous. 

Suddenly a cloud forms. Lightning lights up the daytime sky, thunder causes the very ground they are standing on to shake. Then a rams horn (shofar) is sounded from atop the mountain. It was terrifying. Smoke began to rise from the top of the mountain as if from a furnace. The mountain physically shook under the weight of our awesome God. The sounds were defining. But through all that, came a voice that all the people heard and understood.


&nbsp;
# Day 3 &middot; _The First Sermon on the Mount_

This is truly a remarkable moment when the LORD audibly speaks from the mountain. The only time when the voice of the Father is heard again like this is 3 times during Jesus’ life (Luke 3:22; 9:35; and John 12:28-29).

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 3 &#8729; Question 1** </span><br/><br/>I know you’re all probably really excited that we are at the point in Exodus where the law is introduced. Before we start, when I mention “The Law”, what things come to mind?

&nbsp;

There are a lot of famous Top 10 lists out there. The FBI has a Top 10 Most Wanted. David Letterman is known 
for his Top 10 lists. God also has His. So here’s the question, of all the important things to put on God’s Top 10, what 
would God consider our life’s most important rules? Maybe a better question is do we actually know them? Harpers 
Bizarre Magazine did a survey on how well American’s knew the Ten Commandments. The survey said only 40% of 
Americans could name more than 4 of the commandments. So, if you were just asked cold to name the Ten 
Commandments (in a closed book test), how would you do? Try writing the ones you can remember on your worksheet. 
(Don’t worry, no one will look- and you can change your answers as you read them!)

These Ten Commandments are just that, commandments. They are not suggestions. They are not just 10 good ideas, but 
you can come up with some of your own. They are moral absolutes. They were spoken aloud by God, and everyone heard 
them. They are non-negotiable. The commandments are in order- first with our obligations toward God, and then our 
obligations toward our fellow man. God’s voice that day would speak not only to the people of Israel but to millions of 
people across the centuries.

Why should we even study these? Why are they important? I mean, they don't even cover 1/2 a page in our Bible. They 
were written 3.400 years ago. They can’t be relevant, or can they? 

1. They are found in scripture. That’s all the reason I need. 2 Timothy 3:16 says, `“All Scripture is ____ breathed and is useful for ____, ____, ____ and ____ in righteousness.”` The Bible is God’s curriculum. In school, you can't pick and choose what classes you want to take to graduate. You can’t say, “I’m horrible at math, so let’s skip that one. But I love choir. I’ll take extra music classes.” The school will not pass you because there are requirements you need to graduate. Well…this is God’s curriculum. 

2. It is foundational to our faith. When Jesus spoke, what do you think He quoted from? The Old Testament! Whenever He said, “It is written,” it was from the Law. Can you guess the most quoted book in the Bible by Jesus? Deuteronomy! Deuteronomy is the second giving of the law- a repeat of the law of God! 

3. They are fundamental to our society. Despite what history classes are currently teaching, American law is based on the Law of Moses and the Ten Commandments. 

4. The fourth reason why we should study them is because they have been forsaken in our culture. When a nation departs from God, they will depart from obeying their parents, they will depart from protecting human life, they will depart from fidelity to a spouse. There’s no such thing as truth in our culture any more. It's arbitrary. And what is the end of the line? Despair. Our culture has been told to question authority. And we have. And because of it, we don't say things are “right” or “wrong”, but do what feels right to you at the moment. What is happening to us? 

5. These commandments have been forgotten by the church. The sewage of the world has been seeping into the church. In a recent poll, 78% of Americans think moral values in the US are getting worse. That doesn’t surprise me a bit. But this does shock me- a record-low of 20% of Christian Americans now say the Bible is the literal word of God. No wonder we have new age churches, healing crystal churches and homosexual churches. We’re making up our own laws. 

Why even have the law? In science class, have you ever looked at your hair in a microscope? Your shiny, clean hair doesn’t look so slick under a microscope, its rough and has split ends. The Law is our microscope. It shows us what we need. You can't get cleansed by it, it just shows our need.

In the same way, a mirror reveals the truth about us. I have a love-hate relationship with my bathroom mirror. It tells the truth. I can put soft lights all around, or even dim the lights (ha), but I can’t get ready in the morning without the mirror. The mirror only reveals the need. It doesn't fix the problem. So in the next few days we are going to look into the mirror of these commandments. It’s going to show us who we are, and our need to be cleansed. That’s why Paul wrote in Galatians 2:16, `“a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ.”` What these commandments are going to do is to show us the truth about ourselves, and point the way to Christ so we can be cleansed. Are you ready? 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 20:1-17

&nbsp;

Exodus 20:1: And God spoke all these words: `“I ____ the ____ your ____, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. You shall have ____ other gods before me.”`

In Hebrew, the Ten Commandments are called the _Aseret_ (עֶשֶׂר)<sup>[H6235](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6235/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H6235")</sup> _Ha'Devarim_ (דָּבָר)<sup>[H1697](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h1697/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H1697")</sup>, which literally means the “the ten declararions.” Look back at Exodus 20:1 in the previous paragraph. `“And God spoke all these words.”` 

Notice that God’s first words are not, “Do this”, or “Don’t do that.” He is first showing us the Gospel message about faith in what the LORD has done for His people, not what we can do for Him. 

The Ten Commandments. God’s Top Ten List. God takes all of life and breaks it into two segments. But even simpler than the Ten Commandments, God expects two things of His people. 

1. Supreme devotion to Him- our vertical relationship to God
2. Sincere affection for one another - our horizontal relationship with people.

These commandments are not as a new form of slavery. _Yhwh_ has freed them and He is going to show them how to live in freedom. If your community is building a new playground and it is close to a busy street, the parents are going to encourage a fence around the yard to keep their kids safe. No one is going to argue that the kids need to be free with no restrictions. If that were the case, they could potentially get hit by a car. God’s laws are put in place to protect and provide for His people in their new-found freedom.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 3 &#8729; Question 2** </span><br/><br/>Can you think of examples of how a lack of boundaries and discipline actually creates the conditions for enslavement? 

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 3 &#8729; Question 3** </span><br/><br/>How do the first four commandments (related to our relationship with God) reflect the importance of putting God first in our lives? How can we practically apply these commandments in our daily lives?_

&nbsp;

There is debate on what the first commandment is. Jewish tradition says it is “I Am the LORD Your God.” Catholic, Lutheran, Greek and Eastern tradition says, “You shall have no other gods before me.” We won’t debate it because regardless of how they are numbered, these ten words, spoken by God, speak to us today. 

God is practical. He says, “Look. I’m God and you’re not. I stand alone.” Why would He even need to say that? Because for the past 400+ years, these people have been worshipping all kinds of gods. God is saying that having another god before Him is like worshipping a mannequin. You can dress it up and carry it around, but it’s not real. It's powerless. It’s ridiculous. David writes in Psalm 115:6-7, `“They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see. They have ears, but cannot hear, noses, but cannot smell. They have hands, but cannot feel, feet, but cannot walk, nor can they utter a sound with their throats.”`

After Jesus was betrayed by Judas in the garden there were a detachment of soldiers carrying torches, lanterns and weapons. Jesus, knowing what was going to happen, asked them, “Who is it you want?” They wanted Jesus of Nazareth. “I AM HE” Jesus replied. Jesus was identifying Himself as the “I Am” of the Old Testament. Just as the Roman soldiers and temple police were preparing to arrest Jesus, a supernatural power was suddenly released that it was so strong, it literally knocked an entire band of 300-600 soldiers backward and down on the ground! It was as if an invisible bomb had been detonated. So mush explosive strength was released that the power knocked the soldiers flat on their backs! Can you just imagine when the Israelites heard God, in His own voice, say, `“I Am the LORD Your God.”` 

_Yhwh_ wanted these facts to be so clear, and for all time, that not only did He speak audibly these words, but later, His own “finger” would carve those same words into stone tablets.

There are actually more than 10 declararions (laws), there are a total of [613 commandments](https://www.jewfaq.org/613_commandments) or _Mitzvah_ (מִצְוָה)<sup>[H4687](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4687/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H4687")</sup> in the Torah. In a way the ten commandments summarize the rest of the commandments and form a foundation. It is not because these are mandatory and the rest are optional. We’ll get to those later. 

Exodus 20:2. So the first declararion is _I Am Yhwh_, Who Brought You Out Of The Land Of Egypt_. God is making it clear that He is the God of the Hebrews. But we will also find that as we read the Torah, that foreigners (gentiles) may also join Israel. Yahweh is also making it clear that the Lord redeems, yes, and the redeemed have obligations to Him. This means that if you are redeemed, then you are loyal and obedient to God. You don’t get to pick and choose what you obey. The first commandment tells us whom to worship. 

Exodus 20:3-6. The second declararion is _No Other Gods_ There are four principles here, and for some reason, this commandment is the one that trips people up- both in Biblical times and our current culture. The Bible says: 

1. no other gods, 
2. don’t make images of symbols of deity 
3. don't worship images or symbols
4. there is punishment for violating these three principles which will last beyond you and affect your children. 

The Hebrews absolutely believed there were other gods in existence. And every known god had some type of representation. They weren’t sure how to relate to 
_Yhwh_ without an idol. The second commandment tell us how we are too worship. 

An idol is simply anything or any one that replaces God. It is anything or anyone that takes supreme devotion away from God. That’s an idol. You can drive an idol. You can live in an idol. You can date an idol. You can marry an idol. You can raise idols. You can spend you free time with an idol. Your hobbies or sports can be an idol. If anyone or anything takes away supreme devotion to God, anything can become an idol. John puts it this way in 1 John 5:21, “Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.”

&nbsp;

**<i class="fa-solid fa-scroll"></i>&nbsp; Exodus 20:7. The Third Declararion**: _Do Not Take God’s Name In Vain._ 

In ancient times, they inscribed divine names as a seal (like in a signet ring), in stone inscriptions, and on humans in the form of tattoos. These tattoos were put on human hands or faces to signify that they belonged to this god. When deity names were found on seals or stone, it implied that the deity owned and protected whatever it was that the name was found (building, declaration letter, etc.). The god’s reputation was bound in what they owned. Remember, this is on the heels of God saying not to have no other gods before Him.

God’s name is _Yahweh_ / _Jehovah_. God’s name is not _God_. Speaking God’s name in vain is not just using swear words, or making a promise and invoking God’s name. It also means falseness, worthlessness, carelessness, or emptiness of speech. How many times a week do you hear God’s name being used falsely, or without worth? Using God’s name should be something we do with great care and reverence. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 3 &#8729; Question 5** </span><br/><br/>Look up Exodus 20:7 in different translations (www.biblegateway.com): Try the following examples: [The Amplified Bible](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20%3A7&version=AMP) | [NLT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20%3A7&version=NLT) | [MSG](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20%3A7&version=MSG) | [Complete Jewish Bible](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20%3A7&version=CJB), etc. What did you find?

&nbsp;

The word vain in the Bible means “emptiness, false, lies”. Using God’s name in vain is to empty that name of it’s value, its content, its meaning. God's name should never be used, written, sung, etc. in any kind of empty, frivolous or insincere way. Jesus put it this way in Matthew 12:34, `“the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.”` Your mouth is a barometer of your heart. Careless speech comes from an unguarded heart. If I were carrying a very full bowl of soup, and you bumped into me, what would happen? Yes, the soup would spill. When someone bumps into you in life, what words spill out of your mouth? 

Biblical names are the equivalent to reputation, character, and authority. Names make a difference! When David came to Goliath he said, “You come to me with a sword and spear, and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.” (1 Samuel 17:45).

If certain parts of the world if you defame the names of Buddha or Muhammad, you could be killed. But we think nothing of saying, “Jesus Christ”, or “I swear to God” not as praise, but in a defaming way. We degrade God’s Holy name when we ask God to damn something. God isn’t about condemning people. He is about saving people. When we hear these words over and over and over again, we become desensitized to it. So, what are you going to say the next time you hit your thumb with a hammer? How about , “Thank God it was only my thumb!” Or, think of something else. My assistant at school always says, “manischewitz.” It cracks me up every time, but she's learned not to use God’s name in vain. 

```
"Let your _____ be always full of _____, seasoned with _____, so that you may know how to answer everyone." - (NIV Colossians 4:6)
```

So in this commandment, God is putting His name on the people to claim them as His own and is telling them, “Act like my people. You are my representatives. Live like you belong to Me.”

The law is not a means of earning salvation. In God’s Top 10, I don’t read this command as just not using God’s name as a swear word- although I DO think that encompasses it. It’s bigger than that. It is a means of demonstrating God’s character. It’s part of our mission. Our obedience to God is not just about our relationship to Yahweh, it's our actual testimony to the world. The way you live matters. 

```
“I will give you a ____ heart and put a ____ spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of ____ and give you a heart of ____.” - (NIV Ezekiel 36:26)
```

This is not about getting rid of the law because it didn’t work. God is planning on changing us so we can be faithful to His law. The law is not the problem. Our unfaithfulness it. 

In Matthew 6:9, Jesus teaches us how to pray, “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.” Jesus is saying that _Yhwh's_ name is holy. God, help us to live a life that honors you so that your reputation is attractive. Wow, that’s a high calling. Again, we bear God’s name. The way we live matters.

# Day 4 &middot; _Relax - That's an Order_

**<i class="fa-solid fa-scroll"></i>&nbsp; Exodus 20:8-11 The Fourth Declararion**: _Keep The Sabbath_

The argument about the _Sabbath_ has been a hot debate for many years. I don’t think I can solve this debate, but perhaps I 
can give you some food for thought. 

This commandment shows God’s tenderness, grace and mercy as He commands His people to relax, to rest, to take a weekly vacation. We need a vacation from our vocation. For the millions of slaves that were hearing this for the first time, they had no idea what it was to take a day off in Egypt. God puts this at the Top of his Top 10, and it's an order! 

God’s a pretty good judge of human character. I mean, he actually commands us to rest. People actually brag about breaking this commandment! That’s nuts! We have become a generation of people who worship our work, who work at our play, and who play at our worship. When we meet someone for the first time, we typically shake their hand and ask their name. What's the second question? What do you do for a living? 

Let’s do a quick review before we look more closely at this one. The first commandment: Worship the right God. There are no other gods. You can’t pick and choose. Second, you must worship the right God in the right way. You don't decide what is correct worship, God does. The third commandment is not only do you worship the right God in the right way, but even down to honoring His very name. Name means character, reputation, and authority. The fourth commandment is all a part of this flow. We do all the above and we worship all day on a special day; the whole day is devoted to the Lord.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Question 1** </span><br/><br/>Keeping the Sabbath holy is mentioned 90 times in the Old Testament, and another 50 times in the New Testament. The Hebrew word is _Shabbat_ (שַׁבָּת)<sup>[H7676](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7676/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H7676")</sup>. The primitive root literally means _To Cease_ (שָׁבַת)<sup>[H7673](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7673/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H7673")</sup>.  What are the goals of the Sabbath? The idea is to put an end to the workweek.

&nbsp;

If we were in Israel, Shabbat starts when you see the first three stars in the night sky on Friday night, and it continues until Saturday evening at sunset. Why? Because that's how creation was. It was evening first, and then morning that was the first day. Is this the first time the Sabbath is mentioned? No. It was mentioned in Genesis when God rested on the 7th day. 

God didn’t rest because He was tired. He rested like a king rests after everything in His kingdom is all put in order and he rests looking at how everything is working. When the house is cleaned on Saturday, then on Sunday, when it’s time to rest, we can really rest. We’re not looking around and thinking of all the things we need to do. We are looking around and seeing order, and resting. 

Who is to take the Sabbath? Believers. This means that your kids are to have the day off. Your employees are to have the day off. Even your pets get the day off! Even the land gets a Sabbath! 

In Genesis the world was created in six days and on the seventh day God rested. He ordered that the 7th day be called _Sabbath_ / _Shabbat_, and set aside to be observed as holy.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Question 2** </span><br/><br/>What are the goals of the Sabbath? The goal behind the Sabbath is simple. Stop your regular work. Focus on your family, on _Yhwh_ and His Word, and relax and enjoy one another in a day of physical and spiritual renewal. The most important thing is that you are being obedient to the LORD’s commands. Remembrance is commanded, so how can we remember to keep the Sabbath? Write it in your day planner! Fit it in your schedule to just chill with your family and friends. Go to church. Eat together. 

&nbsp;

God wants us to work. As a believer, we should have the best work ethic of anyone. Use those six days to be productive. And then rest. Life is about balance. I admit, I’m not too good at this one. Resting is hard for me. This week I got Covid. And God pretty much gave me a forced rest. I couldn’t get up for a week. I tried to write this Bible study during my awake times, and literally threw everything away. Eric wanted me to keep it because it would look like I was speaking in tongues. Ha! If I have any advice, rest on your own. It's not so fun when God makes you lie down in green pastures!

**<i class="fa-solid fa-scroll"></i>&nbsp; Exodus 20:12 The Fifth Declaration**: _Honor Your Parents_

This is the first of the list of the horizontal commandments. The first four commandments are all about my relationship with God. The second six are all about ways to get along with people. It’s also the “Because I said so” commandment. You know how it goes with kids, “Why should I clean my room?” (Because I said so.) “Why do I have to eat my vegetables?” (Because I said do.) 

Why do we have to keep all of the commandments? Because He said so. Why do we have no other gods before Him? Because He said so. Why do we keep the Sabbath? Because He said so. Why is this command first? Because everyone has, or had had, parents! Every person is not a husband or wife, so adultery doesn't apply to everyone. But this one applies to every human being. The foundation of everything is the parent-child relationship. All of life, it were boiled down to one word would be relationships. That’s how Jesus saw it. He boiled down all of these commands into love God, love one another. 

So why is it that the relationships that are the most precious are also the most precarious? 

1. We have unrelenting pressure from our culture. Our culture actively attacks the family and family values. Our world mocks the 5th commandment. How many TV shows depict parents as absolute morons? Are there any TV shows now that show respect for the family??? 
2. We have lost the priority of our family relationships. It's not intentional, they just aren’t maintained. There’s no auto pilot for family. 
3. Parents can be unsteady. Yes, this commandment is for children, but parents were once children. When families don’t follow this command, then a bad cycle begins. Children need to see their parents respect and honor the Heavenly Father. 

Children need to show proper respect and proper care to their parents. The family is central in the Lord's plan for mankind. That’s why our culture is trying so desperately to separate traditional family values. God has ordained an authority structure for families. This command does not say “honor your father or your mother. Take your choice.” The idea is you honor both of them. Here’s what we need to do. We need to fight our culture. Be counter-cultural; be a revolutionary in this one. Break the trend, break the cycle. Honor your parents. Honor the family and traditional Christian family values. 

There’s only one person in the history of the earth who has kept the fifth commandment perfectly, and that is the Lord Jesus Christ. He’s the one we’re to follow; the One we’re to look at watch what He did and how He did it. 

**<i class="fa-solid fa-scroll"></i>&nbsp; Exodus 20:13 The Sixth Declaration**: _Do Not Murder_ 

Ah-ha! The first commandment that is the easiest to follow. I mean, all the others so far have had a personal application, but no one here has actually plotted out another person’s murder, right?! Murder has literally been a problem with mankind from the very beginning. The first crime ever committed was a homicide in Genesis 4. Actually homicide is the fourth leading cause of death in our country. The first is heart disease, the second - cancer, and the third is accidents. 

The word “murder” means just that- intentionally killing another human being for personal reasons. It did not mean the people of Israel couldn’t go to war. It means that life is sacred, and because life is sacred, you cannot intentionally kill another human being for personal reasons. Death must be viewed through the lens of life. 

So if every year, in our public schools, we are teaching our children, “you’re just an animal”, “you come from animals”, why would we be so surprised if they start acting like animals? Should we be surprised? But we are not just animals. We have been made by God and life is a gift from our Creator. 

```
“Then the LORD God ____ a man from the dust of the ground and ____ into his nostrils the breath of ____, and the man became a ____ ____.” (NIV Genesis 2:7) 
```

Life is a gift from God and we are made in the image of God. We are capable of imagination, being creative, reasoning. We have the ability to long for God, to have a relationship with God. We were made for eternity. Life is sacred. Man is wicked. If you took away every gun in the world, men would pick up stones or clubs. The problem is in a man's heart.

Matthew 5:21-22 Jesus said, `“You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘You shall not ____, and anyone who ____ will be subject to ____,’ But I tell you that anyone who is ____ with a brother or sister will be subject to ____.”` Jesus widens the definition of murder. He says, this is more than a civil issue, it’s a spiritual issue. 

The word “angry” in Matthew 5:22 is the greek word “orgizo” - it is a passive anger, it’s seething. It’s an attitude. Do you harbor a grudge, are you tearing someone down by gossip? No, you didn’t kill them, but Jesus says we’re still guilty. Anger starts in the heart. 

In Ephesians 4:26 Paul says, `“In your anger, do not _____. Do not let the sun go down while you are still ____.”` That’s good advice. Confront the problem. Admit it and correct it. 

Murder is a sin. And we haven’t even touched on abortion, euthanasia, and suicide

# Day 5 &middot; _Dear Abby_

**<i class="fa-solid fa-scroll"></i>&nbsp; Exodus 20:14 The Seventh Declaration**: _Do Not Commit Adultery_

A number of years ago a letter was published to Dear Abby. “Dear Abby, I am in love and I’m having an affair with two different women. I can’t marry them both. Please tell me what to do, but don’t give me any of that morality stuff.” Abby’s answer was classic. “Dear sir, the only difference between humans and animals is morality. Please write to a veterinarian.” 

Adultery can devastate a family. And we all must be on our guard, men and women alike. Let’s begin with this: the Ten Commandments are not meant to be restrictive, they are meant to be protective. When God says, “Honor your father and mother” He is putting a protective fence around the family. When He says, “You shall not murder” God is putting a protective fence around life. Now God is going to put a hedge around the marriage relationship. 

Promiscuity is everywhere- in our sports heroes, musicians, actors and actresses, politicians, on TV… It’s socially fashionable. And God knew this would be a problem. Hollywood puts it in our face every chance they get. Sexual promiscuity is popular both before marriage and unfortunately even during marriage. Jesus said that one of the marks of the last days is that it would resemble the days of Noah and the days of Sodom and Gomorrah. In both of these times both heterosexual and homosexual activity was rampant. Many Biblical men and women struggled with this: Samson and Delilah, David and Bathsheba, etc. 

Once again, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus raises the bar on the commandments. Read Matthew 5:27-28. The man in the audience must have dropped their jaws. “Whoever looks”… it's an ongoing continual process. 

Adultery can damage a person spiritually. You lose your peace, your joy, you break fellowship with God. It can damage you physically with sexually transmitted diseases. It can damage you emotionally with guilt. It can damage your family, your mate, your kids. It can also damage the community. When one member of the Church suffers, we all suffer. Sin is very, very expensive. Hollywood won’t tell you that. But it is also forgivable. The Bible says, “If you confess your sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from… all unrighteousness.” God’s grace is bigger than any sin. 

Adultery is also preventable. Just ask Joseph who was sexually assaulted by Mrs. Potiphar. He walked away… ran, actually. Keep appropriate distance in your relationships. Flee temptation. 

**<i class="fa-solid fa-scroll"></i>&nbsp; Exodus 20:15 The Eighth Declaration**: _Do Not Steal_

This means exactly what it says. Stealing was a problem from the beginning of time. Watchtowers were invented so you could watch in case thieves would come onto your land. God is drawing a fence to protect personal property.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Question 1** </span><br/><br/>God’s commandments are all about protecting and providing for us. In the first commandments, or words, God is showing us whom to worship, _Yhwh_ alone, and how to worship (no idols, no distractions). Can you fill in the rest of the commandments with what is God protecting in commands 2-10? (Can you name them in 1-2 words?) I’ll give you a start: in #3 God is protecting His name.

&nbsp;

In the Old Testament if you stole something, you had to pay it back with 20%. If you stole an animal, you pay it back double. If you stole and animal and killed it, you paid back 4-5 fold! If you stole a human (kidnapping) it was punishable by death. It can be pretty expensive to steal. There was no prison system in the OT. It was about restitution. You will work it off and pay it back. 

The Roman culture punished thieves even more severely- including at the least a public flogging. Next to Jesus on the cross were two thieves. 

The American Culture has a victim mentality. Shoplifters cause businesses $16 billion a year. One in 3 businesses will close due to shoplifting. 70% of all shoplifters are in the middle bracket. 20% are in the upper income bracket. Surprised? 

This commandment implies that people will own something. Socialism says everything belongs to the state. Capitalism says everything belongs to the individual. The Bible says everything belongs to God! We are stewards of what God has given us.

**<i class="fa-solid fa-scroll"></i>&nbsp; Exodus 20:16 The Ninth Declaration**: _Do Not Lie_

In Proverbs 6:16-19 Solomon lists 6 things that the LORD hates. Lying and a false witness are on that list. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Question 2** </span><br/><br/>How are we as a culture, as a country, in telling the truth? How can we do better? Where do we start? Ha! Sometimes I wonder if we would even recognize truth if it hit us. We lie about all kinds of things. God wants us to have verbal integrity. Our God loves truth. And perfect truth does not tolerate evil. 

&nbsp;

Lies can do a lot of damage to people. No wonder that Jewish law made sure that testimonies would need to be absolutely reliable. Here is their criteria: One witness was never enough. Two witnesses at the least (or more) were always needed if a charge was to be handed down. The witnesses were examined independently. If there was a contradiction, the evidence was dismissed. A witness could only testify to what he or she actually saw or heard themselves- or their entire testimony was invalid. If a person was found as a false witness, they would be given the same penalty as the one on trial in some cases, double the penalty. For instance, if the one to be found guilty was to get 40 lashes, the false witness was to be given 80 lashes. 

When the woman found guilty of adultery was brought to Jesus, He said, “He who has no sin cast the first stone.” Then he bent down to write in the dirt. Perhaps he wrote the names of the men who were accusing her. Whatever He wrote, He knew that any stone cast by a false witness would go back on them. 

Something we need to remember is truth is truth. There is no “my truth” and “your truth.” The truth of God cannot be changed and it is never, never negotiable. 

Katy and Becca have new babies (well, the will have by the time you are reading this). And as much as I think that these babies are perfect in every way, they are flawed. They have a sinful nature. We will not need to teach them to lie. Sadly, it will come naturally.

**<i class="fa-solid fa-scroll"></i>&nbsp; Exodus 20:17 The Tenth Declaration**: _Do Not Covet_ 

Getting more things and stuff will not make you happy. But your attitude towards these things can make all the difference. 

"Affluenza" is an epidemic in our country. It infects the very young and the very old. Solomon nailed it when he said in Ecclesiastes 1:8 `“The eye never has enough ____, nor the ear its fill of ____.”` Affluenza is the painful, contagious, unfulfilled socially transmitted feeling that is the result from feelings of keeping up with the Jones. We are 3x more wealthy than we were in the 1950s. But there is also much higher incidences of anxiety and depression. We got more stuff. Why aren't we happier? 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Question 3** </span><br/><br/>Who in your life is the happiest, most contented person you know? Why?

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 5 &#8729; Question 4** </span><br/><br/>List the things you should not covet, according to Exodus 20:17.

&nbsp;

You may be thinking, oh, this one is going to be easy. I don’t have any need of a donkey or ox, and we don’t have slaves, so I get an exemption from the tenth commandment. Ha! All of these items have to do with 3 belongings that people want: 1- things, 2- people and 3- cultural status. Most people wouldn’t put this in a Top 10. Murder, yeah, I get it. Lying, adultery… yep, all understandable. But Coveting? 

What does _Covet_ even mean? The Hebrew word for covet is _Chamad_ (חָמַד)<sup>[H2530](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2530/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H2530")</sup> and means “to strongly desire or delight in something that is off limits”. What’s so bad about that? It is the word in Gen 3 when Eve was tempted by Satan. She looked at it and _Desired_ it because it would make her wise. 

Have you ever looked at one of those Sky Mall catalogues? It's full of stuff that you never knew you needed. I bet you never knew you needed a Bigfoot Yeti Statue (only $200!)! Or how about a Sumo Wrestler Table at $630? These are real things! There are so many random things in there! 

The tenth commandment is unique in that it deals with the inward and not the outward. It is not an action. You don’t see covetousness. Paul gives himself a report card in Philippians 3. He was circumcised on the 8th day, he had zeal for the law… and “as for righteousness based on the law, faultless.” (Vs 6). But in Romans 7:7-12 Paul realizes that once he meditated on this 10th commandment, that this particular command proved him not as blameless as he thought he was. He had a deep conviction of sin over this commandment. 

When a person covets, it reveals a deep dissatisfaction with what God has provided for them. It can be anything. They are unhappy about it. Maybe they feel like they deserve a better wife, bigger house, different gender… 

Hebrews tells us to be content with what we have. When an unbeliever looks at an discontented believer, what will they think? If they are always complaining, why would anyone want to listen to your testimony? Happiness is always an inside job. Lasting happiness never comes from the outside. Affluenza is a curse, and it is highly contagious. It reveals dissatisfaction with God's provision. 

In verse 17, _Your Neighbor_ is refereed to 7 times. That’s a lot of times. If whatever your neighbor has what you want, then they will become disdainful to you. 

What is the cure for affluenza? Contentedness. Hebrew 13:5 says, `"Keep your life free from love of money, and be ____ with what you have, for he has said, ‘I will never leave you nor forsake you.’”`
