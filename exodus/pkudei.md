# _P'kudei_ &sdot; פקודי
Parashah 23 &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; _Accounts (_ 38:21&mdash;40:38 _)_

The twenty-third reading from the Torah and last reading from the book of Exodus is called Pekudei (פקודי), which means
_Aaccount_ or _Reckonings_, because this Torah portion begins with Moses making a careful accounting of the gold, silver, and 
copper donated by the people for the construction of the Tabernacle. The first words of the first verse of the reading is 
translated to read, `"These are the accounts [pekudei] of the Tabernacle (Exodus 38:21)`.

# Day 1 &middot; _Accounting_

Birth. It's exciting. It's painful. The nation Israel is out of the delivery room of Egypt…that was the painful part. God already let Abraham know that labor would be difficult. 

We’re going to wrap up this last week by looking at Genesis-Revelation. Let’s do this. 

```
Then the LORD said to him, "Know for ____ that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and that they will be ____ and ____ there." - (Genesis 15:13 NIV)
```

And what does God follow that up with?

```
"But I will ____ the nation they &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; as slaves and afterward they will ____ ____ with great ____.” And boy, did they! - (Genesis 15:14? NIV)
```

I’m a little sad that our time is coming to an end in this study. I have really enjoyed learning with you and making so many new connections. But we're not done yet! 

The book of Genesis captivated us with creation and beginnings. It unveiled the dawn of heaven and earth, introduced us to sin, and began God's plan to rescue His people. It was also the beginning of the first family. Likewise Exodus is a book of remarkable beginnings. It brought us the birth of a nation, the Israelites, as God's chosen people. Within Exodus we saw themes of of oppression, deliverance, redemption, sacrifice, the priesthood all of which foreshadow the coming of Jesus.

Before we jump into the last portion of Exodus, I want to reemphasize a crucial point. Each one of us has experienced a Genesis, a unique beginning. But not everyone has encountered an Exodus- a liberation from the bondage of sin. 

Exodus 38:8 They made the bronze basin and its bronze stand from the mirrors of the women who &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 

Just one note before we move on. Who are these women gathered at the tabernacle door? And what service are they doing? According to the Jewish Talmud and Midrash, these were women who dedicated their lives to prayer. There are two verses in the Hebrew Bible where women are serving in the Tabernacle (Exodus 38:8 and 1 Samuel 2:22). They would gather and pray for the priests, and for the nation of Israel. They dedicated themselves to this. Later, in 1 Samuel, when Eli was High priest, the Bible says his sons did not know the Lord. They would sleep with the women who came to the door of the tabernacle, taking advantage of them. 

In the eighth chapter of Hebrews, the writer says that the priest in the tabernacle and the temple served in a structure - the tabernacle, and that was a copy of what was going on in heaven. Where is God’s true abiding place? Heaven. The tabernacle is a mirror, a shadow, a model of what is going on in heaven. 

In Revelation 4, John goes to heaven. He is going to see some very similar to the tabernacle. John sees the throne of God, not the Ark of the Covenant. Instead of God being between the cherubim on the Mercy Seat, John sees God on his throne (vs 2). Instead of one priest dressed in white coming to the Mercy Seat, there are 24 elders all dressed in white with crowns of gold (_Verse 4_).

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>What other shadows from the tabernacle do you see in Revelation 4? This is the real deal. `Also in front of the throne there was what looked like a ____ of glass, clear as ____. (Revelation 4:6 NIV)`. Why do you think John sees a sea of glass? Why glass? 

&nbsp;

In heaven, we will be standing on the finished work of Christ. There will be no need for cleansing. We will be standing on solid ground. It is not a laver of water, as in the tabernacle, or like a molten sea from Solomon’s Temple (1 Kings 7:23-26; 2 Chronicles 4:2-5,10), but it is a sea of glass, clear as crystal. It is the finished work of Christ. 

```
These are the ____ of the materials used for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the ____ ____, which were recorded at Moses’ command by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest. - (Exodus 38:21 NIV)
```

_Verse 22_ talks about Bezalel again (one of my favorites!) - `made everything the LORD commanded Moses`. According to this verse, who was Bezalel’s father? Who was his grandfather? Why go back to the third generation?

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>Look back at Exodus 17:10-12. Who was Hur and why is he significant? 

&nbsp;

Hur helped Moses in his ministry in the beginning, and here is his grandson, watching his steps and actions and has a heart for ministry, just like his grandfather. What a blessing for Moses to see generations of families come under his leadership. 

Then he blessed Joseph and said, “May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked faithfully, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day, the Angel who has delivered me from all harm - may he bless these boys. May they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they increase greatly on earth. 

God’s work is carried out like a relay race, with one generation passing the baton to the next. God has been faithful. If you have had the blessing of a grandparent or parent who prayed for you, you understand. If you have not, then be the first to start praying for the generations to come. I can tell you one thing from being in education for many years, this generation needs Jesus more than ever. We need to cover our kids and grandkids with God’s protection. And we can only do that by example. Can you even fathom how many generations have passed down the promises of God?

# Day 2 &middot; _Transformation_

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 38:1-8

&nbsp;

Let’s just refresh our memories- there were three compartments to the tabernacle: the outer court, the holy place and the Holy of Holies. The outer court was where the priest went to sacrifice and wash. It measured 75’x150’. The holy place was 15’x30’ and had three articles of furniture” the Table of Showbread, the Lamp Stand, and the Altar of Incense. The veil separated the holy place from the Holy of Holies. In that secret spot of the Holy of Holies is where the high priest went once a year to meet with God. 

Inside the Holy of Holies there were three items: a copy of the law (that's really the second copy), Aaron’s rod that budded and a jar of manna. Those things were kept as reminders. 

Israel got represented in three different ways in the tabernacle: 
1. The Table of Showbread 
2. The high priest would carry stones on his shoulders with the names of the tribes 
3. The high priest wore an ephod with 12 stones, one representing each of the 12 tribes. The priest represented Israel before God, and represented God before Israel. 

From pure gold they made the utensils, dishes, cups, bowl, etc. In 70 AD, the Roman Emperor, Titus, the son of Vespasian, destroyed the city of Jerusalem and took some of the utensils back to Rome. I showed you a picture of his victory march with the Table of Showbread and the Lamp Stand. 

![Lamp Stand](http://www.biblical-finds.com/images/titusarchrelief_480.jpg) 

This relief in the stone has been there since 70 AD, and is still there today. 

Why did they need a lamp in the holy place? There was no natural light inside the holy place. So the priests would be unable to perform their duties without the light. Twice a day, morning and evening, the priest would go and tend to the lamps and put incense on the altar. 

Where did the fire on the Altar of Incense originate? The fire came from a coal from the altar in the outer court yard, on the Bronze Altar where the sacrifices were made. A coal was taken from the sacrificial altar into the prayer or incense altar which symbolized there is no approach without sacrifice. There is no worship, no prayer, and no relationship with God without sacrifice. The only way to approach is through the blood of Jesus that was shed for us. 

I suppose we end our prayers by saying "in Jesus' name” to show that it was Jesus who would be the mediator and allow us into God's presence. 

```
And we _, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord's glory, are being _ into His image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is Spirit. - (2 Corinthians 3:18 NIV)
```

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 2 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>Look up 1 Corinthians 3:18 and write what the word transformed means. The word is metamorphoo. What English word does that sound like to you? Where have you heard it?

&nbsp;

It means a total and complete change. It's a word used to describe the larva - caterpillar and caterpillar - butterfly stages. A caterpillar starts it life inching along the ground, eating and growing. It feeds on leaves and is known for being hungry. As it eats it undergoes several profound changes within its body, yet it is still caterpillar. Watch the video below.

&nbsp;

When it’s time, the caterpillar enters a transformative phase called the chrysalis. Inside this protective casing, hidden from the world, a miraculous process unfolds. The caterpillar’s body undergoes a complete overhaul, breaking down its old self and restructuring into something entirely new. In this phase, the caterpillar needs to surrender itself to the process.

&nbsp;

After the waiting period, the chrysalis cracks open, revealing the emergence of a beautiful butterfly. It does not resemble it's old self in any way. It has a new way of walking and even a new way of eating. The once earthbound caterpillar now soars freely through the air, displaying vibrant colors and grace in its movement.

Exodus 38:8 They made the bronze basin and its bronze stand from the &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; of the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 

Mirrors were rare, expensive and nowhere in the list of items God commanded the Israelites to supply. Mirrors in that time were not made like they are today. They were highly polished disks of copper or bronze

# Day 3 &middot; _Garments of Beauty_

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 38:24-29 

```
The total amount of gold from the wave offering used for all the work on the sanctuary was 29 ____ and 730 ____, according to the sanctuary shekel. - (Exodus 38:24 NIV)
```

This is an impressive amount of gold. Its equalled approximately a ton of gold and a little less than 7,000 pounds of silver. 

As of today, June 2023, an ounce of gold costs $1926. A ton of gold would be almost $62 million dollars. And that’s just the gold! Silver is $22.85 an ounce. So 7,000 pounds of silver would be approximately 2.5 million dollars. Now, let’s remember: 

1. They are still in the wilderness. 
2. This is an offering- it is not the entirety of the wealth of Israel at the moment. 
3. This is one offering. 

This is not including any of the other precious metals or stones that would be used in the Tabernacle. These people are being generous to a fault. 

At this time in Israel, a shekel was not a coin, it was a weight. It would not become currency until around the 8-6th century BC. During the eras of Moses, King David, and Kind Solomon, up until the exile of Judah to Babylon, a shekel was not acoin. It was simply a unit of weight. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 39:1-21 

&nbsp;

Exodus 39 going into detail about the making of Aaron the High Priest’s garments. They were very difficult to 
manufacture, as we’ve seen in previous lessons. The colors were very rare and expensive. 

There is something in this chapter that I want to draw your attention to. Either by counting, or doing a search on biblegateway.com, count how many times the phrase “as the LORD commanded Moses” appears. Write that number. &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;

There is an emphasis here. God wants you to know that the people of Israel are obeying Yahweh. They’re doing everything God told them to do as the LORD commanded Moses. There are plenty of times in the past, and soon to happen in the future, that the children of Israel did not do what God has commanded. But here, in chapter 39, they are obedient. It feels good to rest in their obedience. They are setting a good example to each other, and their children at this point. 

This is a time where they gave generously, worshipped wholeheartedly, and gathered in unity. 

There were eight articles of clothing that the high priest wore. Four of those articles were the same ones that the priests in general would wear, but four were special to the High Priest. 

The Ephod was a vest. It was connected together by two stones.

&nbsp;

The High Priest’s garments were also called “garments of ministry” (Exodus 39) and “garments of beauty” (Exodus 28). And they were beautiful and costly. But once a year, on the Day of Atonement, the High Priest laid aside his garments of beauty, and wore a plain white linen garment. He sprinkled blood on the Mercy Seat in the Holy of Holies. The blood was offered for the sin of the people. He laid aside his title, his beauty, and looked like a commoner. What a great parallel of Jesus! 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Philippians 2:6-8 

&nbsp;

Jesus laid all of his glory aside. He left heaven and came to earth and took the form of a man. 

When the High Priest was out in front of the people, he was dressed in the same colors as inside the Holy Place. He represented God to the people. But when he went before God, he stripped off the things that would make him appear holy and represented the people before God. 

Just a note on the stones on the Ephod. There is a lot of symbolism in the stones. The stones are inscribed with each tribe, but they are grouped together symbolizing unity. However, there are two large stones on the shoulders that seem to be a prophetic statement that although Israel is one, they will be divided. Four hundred years from this point, there will be a civil war that will lead Israel to be split the tribes into two kingdoms.

This chapter ends with the completed tabernacle. A formal recounting of everything that was done was customary for the day and reminded everyone of all that they had accomplished.

# Day 4 &middot; _They Did It!_

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 40

&nbsp;

This chapter is the best part! It’s where everything is finished and it all gets set up. Right here, in chapter 40, is where the whole covenant begins. Up till now, it’s all been just planning. 

Notice that in this chapter, as well as in chapter 39, we are going to see the phrase “as the LORD commanded” many times. 

There are two terms that we find in this chapter: The Tabernacle (mishkan - dwelling place) and The Tent of Meeting (ohel - nomad’s tent) (moed- appointed place and time). Mishkan is the tabernacle that they built. The Tent of Meeting (ohel moed) is the tent that Moses set up outside of the camp where he met with the LORD face to face. Both of these terms are mentioned many times in in this chapter. It’s here that they will now become one thing. The ohel moed was temporary until the mishkan was built. 

Verse 20 Moses took the tablets of the covenant law and placed them in the Ark. Which tablets, the first or the second? Well, the second- because the first were broken. But Jewish tradition tells us that Moses included the broken pieces of the first tablet. This is not proven, it’s just a part of their oral history. 

I can picture Moses as he puts the finishing touches on the tabernacle. He lights the lamp, puts the gold altar in front of the veil, and burns sweet incense on it. Moses is performing most of the priestly acts, not Aaron.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>Write the last sentence of verse 33. 

&nbsp;

Let’s do a little celebratory dance for Moses! 

For just a moment, I want you to picture yourself being there. Close your eyes (after you read this, of course) and imagine that the pieces are all in place. The tabernacle is built. The priests are dressed in their garments. Aaron is taking his place as the high priest.

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>Write _Verse 34_. After all of their hard work, the cloud covers the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. It’s moving day for Yahweh. He is dwelling among them just like He said He would. God is giving his seal of approval on the covenant with his cloud and presence. Just imagine that worship service. What do you imagine that was like?

&nbsp;

God does this again when King Solomon finishes the Temple in 2 Chronicles 7:1-16. The glory of the LORD is so strong that the priests could not enter the Temple or perform their duties. The only response the people could give was to bow down and worship with their faces low to the ground. The people wouldn’t leave the presence of God. This worship service lasted 23 days, until finally Solomon told the people to go home. And they did so joyfully and glad in heart for the good things the LORD had done. 

After this amazing worship service _Yhwh_ speaks to King Solomon and says...

```
“If My ____, who are ____ by My name, will ____ themselves and ____ and ____ my face and ____ from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will ____ their sin and will ____ their land.” - (2 Chronicles 7:14 NIV)
``` 

What an amazing response from God. God even tells Solomon that His eyes and hearts will always be there. Why? Because 
of the people’s worship, faithfulness, and obedience. 

Don’t you want to see that again?

```
Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the ____ had ____ on it, and the &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; of the ____ filled the tabernacle. - (Exodus 40:35 NIV)
```

Almost one year after they left Egypt the tabernacle was done. Nine months after they arrived at Sinai the tabernacle was built. The tabernacle is the center of their nation and the center of their camp. God is at the center. God dwells at the center. 

What a great way to end this study, with God at the center. We are redeemed people. Redemption is always expensive and always involves a blood sacrifice. The question is, Is God at the center of your life? Is he dwelling in the midst of your family, your home, your community? 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 3** </span><br/><br/>There is a book by Robert Boyd Munger called My Heart- Christ’s Home. He tells a story of inviting Christ into your heart which is like a home. He leads Christ through each room of his house. I am going to give you his opening line, but I’d like for you to fill in the rest with your own story.</br></br>“I will never forget the evening I invited Him into my heart. What an entrance He made. He came into the darkness and turned on the light…”</br></br>What did Christ see as he walked through your heart for the very first time? What did he not see? Did you show him all the rooms?

&nbsp;

Jesus wants to be the center of your life. Is He? Only you can answer that.

&nbsp;
# Day 5 &middot; _Recap_

&nbsp;

Watch this recap as you walk through the tabernacle in the video: “The Tabernacle and the Messiah.” Does it bring back memories of what you’ve learned? Did you see things differently? Did you notice things you didn’t notice before? 

I can’t wait to meet with you so we can talk about this amazing book and all that we have learned! 

After each book of the Torah is read, once it is finished, whether it’s Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers or Deuteronomy, the congregation in the synagogue says, “Be strong, be strong and let us strengthen one another.” 

Let’s do that!
