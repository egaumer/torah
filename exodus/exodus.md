The Book of _Exodus_

&nbsp;

#### _Introduction_

The Torah consists of the first five books of the Bible.  Exodus is the second book of the Bible. 

In this study, we will read the entire book of Exodus. We will not skip anything, not one single verse. This will be an in-depth study that will challenge your thinking and build your faith. If you skip over reading the Scripture portion, then you’ve missed the most important part of the lesson. 

We will look at various Hebrew words and learn how to discover their meaning. We will look back at the original language so we can see the original meaning. Oftentimes, when Scripture is translated from language to language, it loses some of its meaning. 

Jesus was Jewish. The only Scripture that He had was the Old Testament. There was no New Testament at that time. So when Jesus and the apostles talk about “scripture”, they are talking about the Old Testament. It is crucial for us to understand this history in order to really see what Jesus was meaning and taught. 

The Book of Genesis was all about creation. It was about beginnings. The beginning of heaven and earth, the beginning of sin, the beginning of God’s plan to save His people, and the beginning of a family. Like Genesis, Exodus is also a book of beginnings. It is the book of the beginning of a nation of people, God’s chosen people - the Israelites. 

The central themes of Exodus are oppression, deliverance, redemption, sacrifice, ethics, and the priesthood. All of these themes are forerunners to Jesus Christ.

Let me just make a point before we start. Every single one of us has a Genesis, a beginning. We were born, and now we are here. But not everyone has an Exodus- a deliverance from the bondage of sin. We’ve been born once, but we all have not been born again. If you are reading this and are here, you’ve had a beginning. But you may be at the stage of life where you’ve never been delivered from the bondage of sin by God’s grace. That’s redemption. If that’s you, today, welcome! You’re in the right place! 

Here’s a little phrase to remember: If you’re born once, you’ll die twice. If you’re born twice, you’ll die once. If you are born physically but do not receive Jesus, then you will die physically and spiritually for eternity. (That’s twice.) But if you are born again, born once physically and once spiritually by the Spirit of God in faith in Christ Jesus, you’ll only die once- never to be eternally separated from Him. 

So, congratulations on having a “Genesis” in your life. But make sure there is also an Exodus, a time of deliverance from the bondage of sin.

Each week we will listen and take notes on Pastor Joe’s message. You can either come to Son Light at 10 AM, watch online, or catch the Youtube replay starting on Mondays. bit.ly/sonlightsermons. 

We will meet on Monday nights to discuss what we learned. By that time you should have completed the weekly lessons and taken notes on the sermon. Please be prepared to share what you have learned. 

Feel free to research more and dig deeper! We are so excited to study God’s Word with you this year!
Take notes on what you have learned, any “ah-ha” moments, or questions you may have. We will discuss them all at our Bible Study.
