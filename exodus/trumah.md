# _T'rumah_ &sdot; תרומה
Parashah 19 &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; _Contribution (_ 25:1&mdash;27:19 _)_

The ninetieth reading for the Torah is named _T'rumah_. The LORD commanded Moses to `“tell the Israelites to bring me an offering"`. The word [offering](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8641/kjv/wlc/0-1/) is _T'rumah_ (תְּרוּמָה)<sup>[H8641](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8641/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H8641")</sup>, which is the name of this Torah portion. This word refers to a certain type of offering dedicated to the Temple, like a tittle or first fruits offering. 

God wants to live in the midst of His people. He gives Moses elaborate instructions for the construction of a dwelling place. Exodus 25:8 says, `“Then have them make a sanctuary for me, and I will dwell among them. Make this tabernacle and all its furnishings exactly like the pattern I will show you.”` He describes each of the furnishings in detail, down two the silver hooks and multicolored thread.

# Day 1 &middot; _Echoes of Creation_

The Tabernacle! Yeah! This is one of my favorite parts of Exodus. It’s so easy to read this in auto-pilot and shut your brain off. I mean, are you ever going to actually build this? It’s a lot of measurements and details after all.

Fun fact: there are fifty chapters in the Bible devoted to the tabernacle. Two chapters are devoted to the creation of the universe. Why is that? Perhaps it is because as a shadow of what is in heaven, God wanted us to have a taste. 

When John is taken up to heaven in Revelation 15, he describes "I saw in heaven the temple- that is, the tabernacle of the covenant law - and it was opened..”

```
“They serve as a sanctuary that is a ____ and a ____ of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: ‘See to it that you make everything according to the ___ shown you on the mountain.’” -  (NIV Hebrews 8:5)
```

```
“These are a _____ of things to come; the reality, however, is found in ___.” - (NIV Colossians 2:17)
```

If I had to have theme verses for this study, these would be them! 

God had a very specific plan, down to the tiniest detail, for His dwelling place. Moses was warned to make it exactly how God described, because what he was building was a shadow of Christ. 

A shadow is a representation of the real thing. This is a picture of Macy when she was 5 years old. We were on vacation and it was the first time that she played with her shadow. Her shadow is quite impressive- it has all of the parts of her body - including her fingers and hair. But it is only two-dimensional. It doesn’t have the details. What Moses is going to make is just a shadow. Let’s see what he’s creating! 

There is one door to the tabernacle (not multiple ways in). There is only one way to approach God, and that is through the one door with a sacrifice. Blood has to be shed there before you approach God. This applies to us today, as it did for the ancient Hebrews. And in order to get into the tabernacle, you must approach from the east side- that’s where the door is. And camped on the east side was the tribe of Judah. So, in order to approach the tabernacle you had to go through the tribe of Judah. I’m sure you already know this, but Jesus was from the tribe of Judah. 

Standing on the outside of the tabernacle, you’d see the main building covered in goat hair, animal skins, and cloth. The outer perimeter was white cloth. You probably wouldn’t think, “Wow! This is spectacular!” But if you got to the inside of the tabernacle, you’d see pure white lining, and gold! It was beautiful on the inside, nothing special on the outside. Isaiah 53:2 says, `“He had no beauty of majesty to attract us to Him, nothing in His appearance that we should desire Him.”` Jesus didn’t walk around with a halo over his head - like He is depicted in artwork. But on the inside was pure gold- the glory of God! He was God walking among us as the one source of light, the Menorah. Jesus said, `“I am the light of the world.”` He also said, `“I am the bread of life.”` 

Let’s start off with the last part of Exodus 24. When Moses went up on the mountain, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD settled on Mount Sinai. For &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; days the cloud covered the mountain, and on the &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; day the LORD called to Moses from within the cloud. (Can you imagine how excited Moses must have been to scurry up that mountain, knowing the God was waiting for him?)

What does that sound like to you? Yes! Creation! It’s a pattern! Then Moses goes into the cloud as he went up the mountain and he stayed there 40 days and 40 nights. That’s a long time to be in God’s presence. There’s another pattern here. It’s the pattern of waiting and receiving. Moses waits 6 days, then God speaks. Then he listens for 40 days and 40 nights. 

There is another pattern here, but you have to look a little closer. There are going to be 7 speeches. In your Bible, circle every time you see the words “The LORD said to Moses” or “The LORD spoke again saying.” (Exodus 25:1; 30:11; 30:17, 30:22, 30:34, 31:1, 31:12) and it ends with Exodus 31:18: “When He finishes speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, He gave him the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God.” It seems that God is doing another work of creating here. He has created a new nation, and He is making arrangements so He can actually live among them! 

And just in case you missed it, write the topic of God’s 7th speech starting in Exodus 31:12. (You probably guessed it, didn’t you?!) 

God is assigning detailed tabernacle instructions that are going to require all kinds of artisan work: weaving, carving, measuring, engraving. But he ends all this talk of work with a reminder that they observe the Sabbaths! God is pretty serious about this rest. It is a sign. Outside people will know that the Israelites serve Yahweh because of these Sabbaths. The Israelite culture is going to be set apart and everyone is going to see that they are different. They don’t work nonstop. They have a regular rhythm of rest. (Kind of makes you want to take our Sabbath rests a little more seriously!) When it is all finished, the tabernacle is going to be set apart for the worship of God. 

After Adam and Eve sinned, God banished them from the Garden of Eden. In Genesis 3:24, what was placed to guard the tree of life? &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; In Exodus 26:31, what was woven into the blue, purple and scarlet linen? In Exodus 25:18, what is hammered out in gold on the mercy seat of the Ark of the Covenant?

We have echoes of creation all through the tabernacle. The Tree of Life is echoed in the lamp stand with 7 branches- and the branches are made with buds and petals- it’s literally a tree candelabra! In Genesis 2:12 we have gold and onyx stone. In Exodus 28:6-9 gold thread and onyx stones can be found on the ephod of the priest. And the ark of the covenant is overlaid in gold (Exodus 25:11). It’s as if God wanted the people to say, “There’s an example of creation! And there’s an example of creation!” 

The book of Genesis sets the scene, but it's Exodus that explains sin and how it affects our relationship with God. In Genesis, the spirit of God was hovering over the waters (Genesis 1:2). In Exodus 36:2-7, God is going to raise up two men, Bezalel and Oholiab, who are gifted artisans and had hearts of wisdom. Isn’t that great! God cares about aesthetics. He is a God of beauty and design! 

Exodus 25:9 says, `“Make this ____ and all its furnishings exactly like the pattern I will show you.”` Using the blueletterbible.org, what is the meaning of the word _miskan_ (מִשְׁכָּן)<sup>[H4908](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4908/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H4908")</sup> ? This word is mentioned 139 times in the Bible. When _Yhwh_ wanted to tabernacle with the people, He wanted to dwell with His people.

What did the LORD want?

&nbsp;

This is the first time God takes up an offering, but it’s a special kind of offering. It’s for the tabernacle and the people have to have a willing heart. 

Here’s something interesting. The Israelites just a short time ago were slaves. They owned nothing. They were poor and mistreated. But when they left Egypt, God provided for them by prompting the Egyptians to give them a great amount of wealth. Now, they are in the wilderness, be led by the same God that freed them. Now, God wants an offering. He wants them to have a good heart in giving back to Him what was His all along. God provided wealth for them, and now was asking for some of it back to make a tabernacle. 

Our wealth and health, whatever we have, has been given to us by the Lord. If you have the mind to create items and sell them, God gifted you with your mind that has made you money. If you have a strong body and can work for a living, it is because it has been gifted to you by our Heavenly Father. And now, that gracious God is asking for an offering of a portion of what you have for His work. 

Since it was Yahweh that enlarged them from a family to a nation, freed them from slavery and enriched them with the spoils of Egypt, fed them in the desert, and kept their clothes and shoes from wearing out, it would be fitting that they should devote it back to Him. This was not a tax. It was a love offering. God only wanted it if the people gave with a good heart. The best use of our worldly wealth is to honor God with it in helping with His work. A true giver is not motivated by what they will receive. A generous person gives simply because of the joy of giving. 

In Exodus 25:2, the LORD asks Moses to collect donations only from those who want to give. This offering is something that came from the heart, it was not a tithe. There was no great speech by Moses to guilt or pressure the people into giving. There was no consequence if they did not give, nor was there any reward if they did. The need was shared, and people either gave from their hearts or didn’t. Because this tabernacle would benefit everyone, it would be expected that all the people would contribute in one way or another. 

Where did Israel get 8 tons of gold, silver and bronze to be used for the tabernacle? They brought it with them from Egypt! Remember when the Egyptians were more than happy to give them whatever they wanted just to get rid of them and their God who nearly destroyed Egypt? But let’s get an idea of how much this really is. If we estimate that there were 3 million Hebrew people in the wilderness, it wold have taken less than 1/12 of an ounce from each person to get eight tons. That’s about an equivalent of one small earring per person. It is unthinkable that they didn't have much, much more than that with them. 2 Corinthians 9:7 says, `“God loves a _____ giver.”` 

Here's a thought- maybe we should be giving to God how we would want God to give to us. Does anyone ask God to give sparingly? Or to measure out His blessings as to not go “too overboard”? Hardly. We expect God to give to us abundantly, yet there is sometimes a disconnect with ourselves. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 1 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>When was the last time you gave to the work of the LORD and were truly happy just because you were able to give? 

&nbsp;

Our modern society has misinterpreted the difference between giving, tithing and sacrificing. They are not the same at all. They have different purposes. Sacrificing is exactly that, a blood sacrifice. Jesus has already satisfied the _Torah_ requirement for sacrifice. So, our giving and tithing must be something else…and they are. The giving principal is right here in Exodus 25: it is a freewill offering. We either give freely with a joyful heart out of gratitude for what God has done for us, and because we see the need and our duty to help, or don’t give at all.

&nbsp;
# Day 2 &middot; _The Ark_

Before we dive into the Tabernacle, let’s talk a little about the Old and New Testaments. There are 50 chapters in the Torah with information about the construction and service of the tabernacle. Every minute detail was given by God and repeated with the command to `“make them according to the pattern shown you on the mountain”` (Exodus 25:40). 

The Jewish authors of the New Testament assumed that the readers of the gospels, and the books and letters, already understood the purpose of the tabernacle, later the Temple, and sacrificial system. 

The Torah is about instruction- it teaches us about the holiness of Yahweh, and the great cost that will be necessary for us to be pardoned from our sins. The tabernacle and the sacrificial system are going to teach us the gospel. The tabernacle and the temple are two different things, but were built for the same purpose. The difference is that the tabernacle was portable and the temple was permanent. 

The tabernacle is where God met with mankind. It was called the Tent of Meeting. God wants to be with His people. He says, “I will meet with you there.” It’s a place where they can meet. It wasn’t God's permanent home, it was a “conference room” of sorts. God’s presence moved with the tabernacle so He could be with His people- He’s camping in the desert with His people! Wherever they settled, He was there. Where does God live today? In us! We are the temple of the Holy Spirit. So we go from the tabernacle, to temple, to Christ walking (God in human flesh- tabernacling among us), to know the Holy Spirit living within us. We don’t have to wait for appointed times to communicate with God as Moses did. A church is not God’s house, it is the house of God's people. We, individually and collectively, are the house of God. Hebrews 3:6: `“But Christ is faithful as the Son over God's house. And we are His house, if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory.”` 

Fast forward to Revelation 21:3, “And I heard in a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and He will dwell with them. They will be His people, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.” The word “dwelling place”

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> The Ark: Exodus 25:10-22

& nbsp;

The very first thing that God had them make was the ark. The ark itself was a chest that would hold the two tables of the law (written with the finger of God). It is the holiest of all the furnishings, and was located in the holiest room of the tabernacle: the holy of holies. The ark symbolized God’s presence and His throne. 

The ark was a rectangular chest that served as a storage compartment. The lid was a separate item called The Mercy Seat. When the ark is mentioned, it includes both of these pieces. The ark was so holy that once it was made and put into commission, it was not ever to be touched by human hands. Even on the holiest day when the high priest would enter the holy of holies, he was not allowed to touch the ark- only sprinkle blood on it from a distance of 6-7 feet. Because it could not be touched, rings were built on the sides that held poles. These poles were never to be removed. Later, we will see that while the ark was being carried, it was about to tip over. One of the ark bearers instinctively put his hand on the ark to steady it and he died instantly. 

Here’s a interesting thing to note: in regards to God's instructions for the tabernacle, he gave his instructions from the inside to the outside. God gave instructions starting with the most sacred piece of furniture, the ark, then moved to the holy pieces (the menorah, the table of shewbread, and the altar of incense), and finally to the outer area of the sanctuary the courtyard, where the sacrificial altar was located. This is significant, but we’ll pick it up a little later. 

What did they make the ark out of? It was &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; cubits long, &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; cubits wide, and &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; cubits high. What is a cubit? Scholars disagree on exactly how long this is, but it was an ancient measurement of length based on the distance between the elbow to the tip of the longest finger. It averaged in length between 18-21 inches long. 

God’s choice of wood is very significant. Acacia wood (Hebrew word is shittim) was found in abundance in the Sinai desert. It looks like a humble desert scrub brush, but grows into massive trees. It is well-known for its incorruptibility and resistance to decay, making it suitable for constructing long-lasting structures and objects. It is widely recognized for its strength, resistance to rot/moisture/pests, durability, and beautiful grain patterns. It is 55% harder than white oak!

Right away, there are some shadows of the Messiah that we can see in acacia wood- 

1. it is resistant to decay. Christ’s body never decayed (Ps 16:10). He was incorruptible. It represented Christ’s eternal nature. 
2. Acacia wood and Christ both bore sharp, heavy thorns. 3) Acacia wood was used two construct various elements of the tabernacle and its furnishings, including the altar of burnt offering. This can also be seen of a symbol of Christ’s sacrificial offering on the cross for the redemption of humanity. 
4. Acacia wood is simple, common wood- but was overlaid in gold. These likenesses are something to note, especially with this being the very first item mentioned in the building of the tabernacle. 

Exodus 25:11 gives us the next material needed for the ark. Pure gold. Gold will overlay all of the acacia wood. Gold is mentioned more times than any other precious metal in the Bible. It is valuable because it is pure. It represents the purity and deity of God. Revelation 21:21 says that “The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;, as pure as transparent &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;.”

Gold is a rarity. It is estimated that all the gold ever mined throughout history would fit into a cube with sides measuring about 20 meters. It is often associated with wealth, power, and prestige. Gold is resistant to tarnishing, rusting, and corrosion. Even though gold can be melted down, it does not lose it’s value- quite the opposite! The hotter gold gets, the more it separates impurities, and the more value it holds. It represents God’s deity. Only one person can be the culmination of acacia wood (incorruptible humanity) and gold (deity)- Jesus Christ. 

The atonement cover in Exodus 25:17-22 is also called “the Mercy Seat.” The word atonement means “to reconcile, forgive, be merciful, and pardon, to cover over, to atone for sin.” The Mercy Seat was the same size as the ark, fitting on top of it as a lid. Two cherubim were sitting on the ends of the cover with their wings spread upward and facing each other, lookingtoward the cover. The angels on the mercy seat represent the heavenly hosts gathered around God’s throne. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 2 &#8729; Study Question 1** </span><br/><br/>What was the significance of the Mercy Seat in Exodus 25:22? 

&nbsp;

Exodus 25:22 says: `“There above the cover between the two cherubim that are over the ark of the covenant law, I will meet with you.”` God’s spirit came to rest over the ark- not on the ark. He was _Above_ and between the cherubim. The ark was not even holy or pure enough for _Yhwh's_ holiness to touch it because it was made by man. 

God’s holiness was above all else. It wouldn’t be until Pentecost, after Jesus rose from the dead, that the Holy Spirit would dwell within us. That concept was foreign to the Israelites because they did everything they could to make sure that God’s spirit was kept separate from men. 

According to Jewish tradition, on the day the high priest went into the holy of holies, they were not entirely sure he would come out alive. So they tied a rope around his ankle and put bells on his robe so they could hear him. If he died, they would be able to pull him out, since no one else was allowed to enter that space. Even a replacement high priest could not retrieve him because they were prohibited from touching a dead body. Had the Israelites even conceived the idea of God dwelling in a person, they would have been terrified. Maybe we should be a bit more in awe (a holy fear) of the fact that the Holy Spirit of God lives inside us. 

The law would be placed inside the box and the Mercy Seat was placed on top. Once a year the priest would come and sprinkle blood on top of the Mercy Seat. Two angels would look down at the blood that would cover the Israelite’s failure to keep God’s law. God will act for His people not based on what they had done, but in-spite of what they had done, God would show them mercy and not give them what they deserve. That’s God’s mercy saying, “I want to meet with you. I know you can’t keep my standard. I know you failed and my blood will cover your failure." Aren't you so glad that God looks at you through the blood of Jesus and not at you through the lens of your own failure? 

One person prayed, "Dear God, so far today I've been pretty good. I haven't lied, sworn, stolen anything or cheated. I haven't said a negative word to anyone. I haven't lost my temper or gossiped. I have kept all of your commandments. But in a few moments, God, I'm going to get out of this bed and from then on, I'm gonna need a lot more help. Amen."

&nbsp;

I don’t know about you, but when I imagine angels, I think of winged “people” all dressed in white, flying silently around. But that’s not how the Bible describes angels at all! The Bible describes them asGod’s messengers (Luke 1:26-38) and human’s first reaction is fear. They worship and praise God (Revelation 5:11-14). 

&nbsp;

But the part I love the most is the sound of the angel’s wings. Close your eyes and imagine the sound. I hear soft fluttering, like a dove flying. Ha! Wrong! Read Ezekiel 1:24. What do their wings sound like? Now close your eyes again. What do you hear now? Describe the sound. 

&nbsp;

The ark is also known as a chest, coffin, or box. No matter what the name all of the purposes are the same: to preserve. All of the arks in scripture were meant for preservation. Genesis 50:26 Joseph was put in a coffin (ark). Noah built an ark. Moses’ mother, Jochabed, put him in an ark. I get Noah’s ark and Moses’ ark. But why would this definition of ark include a coffin? Because God’s mercy rests on Jesus’ death. The Mercy Seat rested on the Ark of the Covenant, creating a coffin. Had there been no plan for death, there wold be no possibility of mercy. Both the first item and the last item in this section
refer back to death. There is no access to God but by a death. Thank you, Jesus, that You made a way for us!

&nbsp;

Can you imagine those angels being called for this job? They must have stood motionless as they stretched their wings and faced each other- guarding the most precious life that every lived. I’m sure as they stood there, staring at the eyes of the Messiah, they ran a reel of Him healing the blind, touching a leper and making him clean, and speaking to multitudes. But then suddenly, those eyes opened. And with the sound of mighty rushing waters, their wings shot them straight up into heaven shouting, “HE IS RISEN!” God starts with the ark because this is the innermost part of the tabernacle. He begins with His presence and ends with His people. God always approaches us first. Our relationship begins with His wooing.

&nbsp;

The bread of the Presence or the shewbread was placed on the table on the north wall of the tabernacle. As in ancient times, we also use tables 
for fellowship. It’s where we gather to have a meal. It is very rare to be invited to someone’s house where a table is not prepared. No matter what is served, the outcome is the same: fellowship. 

The table was made from acacia wood and covered in pure gold. The word “shewbread” or “bread of the presence” has the meaning of God’s face upon you. It is symbolic of His presence being in that place. Every week new bread was made and the priests would eat the old bread in the tabernacle. Is could not be taken out of that area. Interestingly enough, wine was also placed on the table with the showbread. What does that remind you of? Of course, communion. Read Leviticus 24:5-9. This is going to give you a little more context of this bread. How many loaves of bread were to be made? What did they represent? ___

The children of Israel were represented before God in several ways: 

1. on the high priest's shoulders were two stones that were inserted into the cloth ephod. The names of the tribes were inscribed on those stones. 
2. The ephod- a breastplate of gold had 12 stones. Each stone represented one of the tribes of Israel. 
3. In the holy place, 12 loaves of bread sat on a table, one for each of the tribes to represent that God would sustain them and give them bread so they would survive the wilderness journey. The bread is called "the bread of presence." The children of Israel were represented in the presence of God. These were unleavened loaves, made without yeast. 

What name did Jesus refer to Himself in John 6:32?

Look at this pattern: the bread of the tabernacle was devoid of leaven, and the Bread of Life was devoid of spot or blemish. He was the manna from heaven offered to all who would partake of the Lord’s table. 

```
"As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it and said, 'If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes. The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side. They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God’s coming to you.'" - (NIV Luke 19:41-44.)
```

In 70 AD the Romans burned Jerusalem down and left the stones of the temple in the street. As the city burned, the gold in the Temple melted. In order to get the gold, the soldiers were ordered to overturn every stone to get it. These stones are on the western wall of the city.

![westernwall](https://bible-history.com/images/common/westernwall-stones-romans.jpg)

Roman soldiers carried the spoils from Jerusalem, including the Menorah and the Table of Shewbread. It is depicted in the 
Arch of Titus in the Roman Colosseum. To this day, no one knows where the Ark of the Covenant is.

&nbsp;

The lamp stand was made of only one material: pure gold. It stood on the south side of the tabernacle. The tabernacle had one door and one source of light. 
Jewish rabbis called the menorah in the tabernacle, and later in the Temple, "the light of the world."

![menorah](https://bible-history.com/images/common/arch_of_titus_menorah-copy.jpg)

&nbsp;

The original menorah weighed approximately 70 pounds of pure gold. It was not melted and put into a mold, it was hand crafted and sculpted. It held seven 
oil lamps that used a special olive oil as fuel.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The lamp stand was decorated with almond branches in various growth stages. Almonds were the first fruit to bud and produce fruit in the spring. This decorative feature would be a prophetic not to the first fruits and resurrection of Jesus. 

Just a note: a seven-branch menorah, like the one in the tabernacle and the temple are not found in Jewish homes today. It would be irreverent to have a 7-branch menorah as it represents the Temple that was destroyed in 70AD. The menorah that the Jews currently have is a 9-branch menorah that came into existence about 100 years after Jesus was born. It was invented for the celebration of Hanukkah, or the Festival of Lights. Someday in the not-so-distant future, a 7-branch menorah will be lit again when the temple is rebuilt. Always keep your eyes on Israel! When the temple is rebuilt, there will most likely be a lot of Jews, and Christians, who will want those 7-branch menorahs! 

The Jews have recreated the Lamp Stand and it is in the The Temple Institute at the Jewish Quarter in Jerusalem. So see a close-up picture, click on this [link](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Menora.JPG). It is a very large picture, so take some time to zoom in and look closely at it. It is solid gold, to the specifications found in the Bible and under bullet-proof glass. 

In fact, the Temple Institute has all the components of the Temple for when they are able to make sacrifices again. The only piece no one knows about is the Ark. 

Is it no wonder that Jesus said, `“I am the light of the world”` (John 8:12), `“I am the bread of life”` (John 6:35), `“I am the door”` (John 10:9). Jesus did not come to abolish the law, but to fulfill it (Matthew 7:17-20).

# Day 4 &middot; _The Tabernacle_

&nbsp;

Thank you for being willing to learn and study, even when the scriptures seem a bit confusing. I hope that as we learn together we can untangle some of these ideas so you can understand that all of the Old Testament points to Jesus. Every law, every command, every piece of furniture- all leads to Jesus.

For us, thousands of years removed from all the specs and instructions for the tabernacle, we can easily become disinterested. But for the children of Israel, this was incredibly important. It was the center of their everything. This is where they would meet with God- the God who freed them from slavery, and currently feeds and waters them (and their flocks) in the desert. It is in this place they will worship God, and sing His praises with choirs. This is where sacrifices were made. It’s literally the center of their camp and the center of their lives. In Europe, when they built their hamlets, they always put a church in the middle of the town with a big spire that would be seen for miles around. The town was built around the church. The idea is that worship of God is the center. 

The first thing to notice is that all of the measurements of the entire tabernacle are in multiples of 5. [Gematria](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/gematria/) is the Hebrew word for “the meaning of numbers.” Numbers are always symbolic in the Bible. The number 5 is no different. It is the number of grace. Everything about the tabernacle is about Jesus- who is full of grace.

&nbsp;

The courtyard was 150 feet long and 75 feet wide. It was measured out with a 7.5’ tall linen cloth. 

The design for this tabernacle is ingenious. Well… it is God who gave it, so there's that! It’s designed to be mobile with easy assembling and disassembling. It was made to withstand the harshest desert conditions: oven-like dryness and fine sand storms. It had to be rugged, yet light enough to travel. The weight of the precious metals alone was eight tons, the wood for construction would be several more tons on top of that. And the cloth would be mighty as well. It took several covered wagons pulled by teams of oxen to transport the tabernacle. But the furnishings, however, the ark, menorah, table of shewbread and incense would hand-carried. 

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 2** </span><br/><br/>God is giving instructions for the frame. On the frame, there are 4 layers of fabrics. What types of fabrics were used on each layer? 

&nbsp;

The first layer is completely white linen embroidered with images of cherubim in blue, purple, scarlet, and find linen. From the inside of the tabernacle you would see this cherubim fabric reflecting the light of the menorah.

God is a masterful storyteller. Look at the list of colors in both Exodus 26:1 and Exodus 35:6. Do you see a difference? The order of the colors is reversed. In Exodus 26 it is `“fine linen, blue, purple and scarlet”` and in Exodus 35 it is `“blue, purple, scarlet and find linen.”` Why do you think that is? God is telling us a story with heavy foreshadowing to His Son!

In the Gospels, Jesus is referred to as “Jesus Christ.” Jesus is first, Christ (His title) is second. But in the Paul’s writings, you and I are sanctified in “Christ Jesus.” The order is reversed. Why? Both titles tell us that Jesus is the Christ. 

Jesus literally means “Salvation”; Christ means “Messiah”. In the Gospels He was the “promised Messiah,” but after He died and rose again, He was “the Promise Fulfilled!” 

Look at verse 6. They are to make 50 gold clasps and use them to fasten the curtains together so that the tabernacle is one unit. All of these pieces are coming together to make one tabernacle. It is unifying. God is saying you are all different, but when you come together you make up the church. We are joined together to make one tabernacle. 

The second layer: Over the artistically designed white linen is a layer of goat hair. It was the consistency of felt. It was the normal material in making a tent. This would have been enough if God stopped there. It is practical and ordinary. 

Goat’s hair is pretty amazing. It contracts when rain hits it to keep out the weather. It protects from the wind, and even expands when it’s hot to let air flow in and keep it cool inside the tent. God is pretty amazing, right?! 

Verse 11- what are the clasps made out of? ____ The clasps on this layer are more mundane. Joined together are the cherubim (God’s glory) and the goats (the ordinary). It is also a little larger than the white linen. As a practical covering, it would go all the way to the floor to protect the white linen from dust, rain, etc. It would also block out all light so the absolute only light you would see would be from the menorah. 

Red rams skins- (male lambs are called “rams). Why red? It points to sacrifices that will be spilt in the tabernacle and foreshadows Jesus’ blood. Every time this layer would be put on the tabernacle, the people would be reminded of the blood of the atonement that would be offered. 

The fourth layer is a bit of a mystery. There have been many interpretations on this one, even with Jewish scholars. Some Bible versions say badger, others allude to porpoise or manatee skin. Whatever it was, it was not elaborate, like the pelt of a lion, or marble, or something exotic that could not be found in the desert. The people were close enough to the Red Sea that any of these options would be available. Again, it was not elaborate. It was practical and not necessarily attractive. The power was inside, not the outside. 

In Matthew 16:13-17 Jesus asked his disciples, `“Who do men say that I am?”` They answered Him with various answers: John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah, one of the prophets… People in Jesus’ day didn’t know what to make of Him, and today is no different. The answers the disciples gave him were that the people saw him as an extraordinary man, but not necessarily God. Today, people call Him a great teacher, a great prophet. They don’t see the Son of the Living God. There were those, however, how were able to pierce the veil and see Jesus for who He really was, like the Roman Centurion (Matthew 8:5-7).

The outer covering is what man sees, but God sees the heart. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

All of those fabrics need to be on a frame. Let’s look at that! OK, we have boards that were made of acacia wood. Now we’ve seen that wood before. Around each board is a covering of gold- but on a foundation of two parts of silver. Could this be speaking prophetically of the Old Testament and the New Testament? God’s work with Jews and Gentiles: two parts in one. Silver, in Scripture speaks of redemption. Literally, the tabernacle was built on the foundation of redemption. It's also joined together with a system of gold-overlaid crossbars. 

Then, again, God reminds Moses in verse 30: `“Set up the tabernacle according to the plan shown you on the mountain.”`

This tabernacle was approximately 15’ wide, 45’ long, and 15’ tall. It’s not as big as you’d think. In 2020, we got to go see a life-sized replica of the tabernacle. I imagined a ginormous structure. It was actually really surprising to see it’s size. But this little tent in the wilderness was worth more than $13 million! This tabernacle was not that impressive from the outside, but the inside was awe inspiring!

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 3** </span><br/><br/>Let’s look at the veil in the tabernacle. Read Exodus 26:31-37.

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 4** </span><br/><br/>The tabernacle was divided into two compartments: The Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. It was separated by a veil. How was it decorated?

&nbsp;

This veil acted as a barrier between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. The last thing anyone was thinking of was open access to God. Only the High Priest went in- with fear and trepidation- once a year on the Day of Atonement. This barrier told people to “come close…but not too close.” 

We don’t know the thickness of this veil, but the veil in the Temple was 4” thick! It was as thick as a man’s hand. That’s extremely thick material. I’ve never seen material that thick before. The Temple veil was also 60’ tall and 30’ across, not 15’ tall x15’ wide. It was pieced together with 72 squares of materials. It took 300 priests to move ONE of those 72 squares. When Jesus died on the cross, that veil was torn in two- from the top to the bottom- not from bottom to top. God ripped the veil.

For all these years there had been a barrier between God and man. But Jesus’ death tore that barrier down. Now there is an open invitation to “Come!”

But do you know what the priests did after Jesus died and the veil was torn? They sewed it back up. They sewed it and continued with their rituals- until the temple was destroyed in 70AD. Human nature. God removes the barrier, humans put the barrier back. God simplifies it, man complicates it. Man wants to earn it, God says, "You can’t earn anything. I’m giving it to you for free.” 

If you look at the graphic map I drew of the tabernacle (in lesson 2) you will notice that when you enter in to The Holy Place, to the right of you is the Table of Shewbread and to the left is the Lamp Stand. What would have been directly in front of you? The Altar of Incense. But it is not described in this chapter, nor in chapter 27, 28, or 29. It’s not mentioneduntil chapter 30! God didn’t forget about it. He has a special place for this piece of furniture.

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;  **Day 4 &#8729; Study Question 5** </span><br/><br/>In verse 36 there is another curtain. This curtain is an exterior curtain. The veil is an interior curtain. Describe this exterior curtain. 

&nbsp;

These posts were cast out of bronze. Bronze was representative of judgement because they had to be forged through fire. Before you even enter the building, there is judgment. In those times, the sacrificial animal’s blood would be brought into those entrance curtains. We see this fulfilled in Jesus Christ. He is our path of entrance. You cannot get to the presence of God without Jesus’ sacrifice.

# Day 5 &middot; _The Altar of Burnt Offering and Courtyard_

&nbsp;

?> <span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Exodus 26:1-19

&nbsp;

Just a recap of where we are. Moses is up on Mount Sinai. He is going to be there for 40 days as God gives him these instructions for the tabernacle. The children of Israel have just vowed to do everything God tells them. We began in the tabernacle, now we’re going to move to the outside. God is giving these instructions from His perspective, not ours. He starts on the inside and works out. We are always coming in the opposite direction. 

When you walk through the entrance of the tabernacle, the first thing you will see is the Altar of Burnt Offering. This is where the sacrifices were made. So, here you are wanting to get close to God and the first thing is you can’t get close unless you have an atoning sacrifice. You need a substitute. This sacrifice will take the place of you atoning for your own sins. An animal will be killed to allow you to have fellowship with God. The children of Israel are all around the tabernacle. They are on the outside; God is on the inside. If you want to get inside, you must bring a sacrifice. 

I always had a hard time with all of the blood sacrifices in the Old Testament. Yes, I get the fact that the tabernacle probably smelled like a big BBQ- but I’m a city girl. Steaks come packaged up in the grocery store, right?! Ha. Yes, of course I understand blood has to be shed, but why so much? Why every day, multiple times, and so many animals? Here is the fact, there would never, never be enough blood to cover our sins, let alone the sins of the whole world… until Jesus. 

The altar was a killing place. It's a place of slaughter. The blood of atonement was poured out here. All offerings were given here.

Hebrews 13:10 - you can hear the writer of this book urging Christians that were perhaps criticized by their Jewish friends saying, “You don’t have an altar.” But the writer emphasizes, “But we have an altar!” Our altar is the cross. Romans 12:1 says, `“Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God- this is your true and proper worship.”`

In John 5:46 Jesus said, `“If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.”` Moses write about ceremonial laws, patriarchs, and the sacrificial system (to name a few things). Moses wrote about the birth, life, sufferings, death and resurrection of Jesus all throughout the first five books of the Bible. The New Testament church just hadn’t seen it yet. 

For the common Israelite, this was the most important piece of furniture. They never saw the other pieces of furniture (Table of Shewbread, Lamp Stand, Altar of Incense and the Ark of the Covenant). But they did see this one. This piece of furniture was raised up and open for all to come and bring their sacrifice.
