# _Tetzaveh_ &sdot; תצוה
Parashah 20 &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; _You are to order (_ 27:20&mdash;30:10 _)_

The twentieth reading from the Torah is Tetzaveh which means “you shall command”, as in the first verse of the reading, `“You shall command the sons of Israel, that they bring you clear oil of beaten olives for the light, to make a lamp burn continually”` (Exodus 27:20). 

This Torah portion begins in the middle of God giving instructions for the tabernacle to Moses. It will focus on the lamp stand and the priesthood. Aaron and his sons will serve as priests, and there are specific instructions for what the priests will wear.

# Day 1 &middot; _The Crushing_

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Exodus 27:20-21.

Exodus 27:20 `“____ the Israelites to bring you clear oil of ____ olives for the light so that the lamps may be kept burning.”`

Inside the tabernacle, the menorah burned continuously. This directive is God's desire for a perpetual flame, a symbol of God’s enduring presence among His people. This flame would be a constant reminder of Israel’s dependence on Yahweh and His guiding light. 

Only the priests were allowed to enter. Every day they tended to the seven lamps of the menorah. The oil they used for the sacred flames was provided by the common people of Israel. The common man could not enter the tabernacle to present their oil, so the priest did on their behalf. They needed a mediator, a go-between, to enter the presence of God. 

I found a great video on how olives were pressed in Nazareth in the first century. You are going to love the symbolism here!

&nbsp;

Where did they take the first fruits of the olive oil? What did the Temple (in this time it was the Tabernacle) use the olive oil for based on Exodus 27:21

&nbsp;

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the video, how many times were the olives pressed? What were the uses for each time?

&nbsp;

The olive industry played a significant role in ancient Israel and is still considered one of the most important agricultural sectors of the region. Olive trees grew in abundance in the land of Israel. The people used it for medicine, perfumes, hygiene, fuel and food. 

Remember, that at this time, the Israelites were not in the Promised Land. They were still in the desert, so harvesting olives was a labor-intensive and difficult process. Plus, olives were only ripe in the autumn. That meant that they needed to work extra hard in those times so that they would have enough oil for the rest of the year. 

In order to get the oil, the fruit (including the seeds) needed to be crushed. In Exodus 27:20, how are the olives supposed to be made? The NIV says _crushed_. The KJV says _beaten_.” The correct Hebrew word is _beaten_ (כָּתִית)<sup>[H3795](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3795/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H3795")</sup>. This method produced the clearest and most refined oil. For the tabernacle menorah, the Israelites were to bring only the finest, first press, of oil.

&nbsp;

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Look up the word _beaten_ (כָּתִית)<sup>[H3795](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3795/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H3795")</sup> in [blueletterbible.org](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3795/kjv/wlc/0-1/) and write down the meaning.

&nbsp;

The beating process started with a large rolling stone that would crush the entire fruit. It was made into a paste and then spread onto woven baskets. These baskets were then stacked and crushed to extract the oil. The oil would flow down the basket and into the collecting vat. 

The olive tree held a symbolic meaning in ancient Israel. It was seen as a symbol of abundance, peace, and divine blessings. Fast forward to Isaiah 53. This chapter is a prophetic glimpse into the sacrifice of the messiah. Isaiah 53:5 says, `"But He was pierced for our transgressions, He was ______ for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on Him and by His wounds we are healed.”`

It is slightly different from the word found in Exodus. How is it different?

&nbsp;

Isaiah's prophecy echoes the imagery of the pressing of olives and connects it to Jesus’ suffering. But the “crushing" in Isaiah is much more intense. It included “break into pieces, bruise, destroy, smite, humble, to be shattered.” Isaiah takes this word and brings it to the next level.

Jesus returns to his disciples three times as he his body is sweating blood. The word _Messiah_ means _Anointed One_.

As I was studying this week, and researching olive oil presses, I came across this video. Dallas Jenkins is the creator, director and co-writer of the show, “The Chosen.” Rabbi Jason Sobel is the reason I first became interested in our Jewish heritage after reading his book, “The Rock, The Road and the Rabbi.” I think they say it best in the 3:00 video.

# Day 2 &middot; _Priest Particulars_

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Exodus 28.

&nbsp;

What did you want to be when you were little? In these days, little kids didn’t get to decide, “Oh, I want to be a priest when I grow up!” You had to be born into the tribe of Levi. And if you happened to be in the tribe of Levi and were a part of the priesthood, you couldn’t just decide to wear something different to work. You had very specific garments that wereworn and they were considered a sacred privilege. 

&nbsp;

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Exodus 28:2 `“Make ____ garments for your brother Aaron to give him ___ and ___.”` What four pieces of garments were the craftsmen to make for the priest?

&nbsp;

The LORD set apart Aaron and his sons as priests. Aaron was from the tribe of Levi. The LORD set apart his entire tribe from the rest of Israel and gave them the responsibilities of the priesthood, but only Aaron's family could be priests. All priests are Levites, but not all Levites are priests. 

The Hebrew word for priest is _Kohen_ (כֹּהֵן)<sup>[H3548](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3548/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H3548")</sup>. Here’s a fun fact, if you are Jewish and you have a last name like Kohen, Cohen, Bowen, Kahan, or Koen, you are probably a descendant of Moses’ brother Aaron and his sons! Your ancestors served as priests in the Tabernacle and in the Temple in Jerusalem. I have been told that of all 12 tribes of Israel, it is the Levi tribe, the Kohen, who are the only ones who can trace their ancestry back to a tribe. All of the other tribal identities have been lost through the generations. 

&nbsp;

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking through this chapter, what colors do you note that are found on the priestly clothing? 

&nbsp;

**Notes on the Priesthood**

* Priests were appointed by God. God calls them and ordains them. No one could say, “I feel led to go into the ministry.” No dice. If you were not related to Aaron, you could not serve. There were no volunteers. This calling was a divine calling upon the family. (Exodus 28:1)

* Priests had special clothing. It set them apart. They could not wear these clothes to their church picnic or out to dinner with the fam. They were special clothing for their ministry. (Exodus 28:2)

* The priests represented the people of Israel before God. (Later, when prophets come on the scene, he’ll represent God to the people.) Because the priest was a representative of the people to God, they wore two stones on their shoulders, each representing 6 of the 12 tribes. They literally carried the tribes on their shoulders to the Lord. Over his heart, on an ephod, will be 12 stones. And on those stones were inscribed the tribal names of the people of Israel. (Exodus 28:6-12, 21, 29-30). We are called to be a holy priesthood. As believers we will bear other’s burdens on our shoulders. This is a big responsibility, and a big service. 

* The priests took their calling very, very seriously. They just couldn’t go running into God’s presence unprepared. Abusing the calling could mean death. It was serious. It was a great calling, but you never went into God's presence lightly. Read what happened to Aaron’s own sons when they decided to do things “their way” in Leviticus 10. (Exodus 28:43) 

* In this time, it was the priests who were responsible for worship services. They handled the sacrifices, took care of the altar fires, lit the menorah, burned the sacred incense, baked the bread of the Presence, and did all of the service of the tabernacle. And most important, they were responsible for teaching the people Torah. 

Other facts about the priests. They did not take vows of celibacy. Only the descendants of Aaron could be priests, not all Levites were priests. Priests and rabbis are not the same. A _Rabbi_ (ῥαββί)<sup>[G4461](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4461/kjv/tr/0-1/ "Strong's Number G4461")</sup> is someone who has gone to rabbinical school ([yeshivah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshiva)) and received ordination within Judaism. Any Jewish boy could become a rabbi.

Obviously the tabernacle and the Temple are no longer in operation, but there are priests today who are waiting for the rebuilding of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem and will be called to duty on that day. 

I found the pomegranates interesting that were sewn around the hem of the robe - with gold bells between them. Why pomegranates? Some of the ancient Rabbis said that there are 613 seeds in a pomegranate- representing the 613 laws found in the Torah. Now, I don’t know if that’s true. I have never counted the seeds in a pomegranate. But I can see how they made that connection. I suppose we’ll have to wait until we get to heaven to find out what was so special about that fruit. (Fun fact - after I studied the Torah the first time, I planted a pomegranate tree in my yard. I really wanted an olive tree… until I found out I was allergic to them. I think I just felt Jannita cringe at the thought of olives! Ha!)

As we look the tabernacle from the outside in, there are white curtains on the outside. But the further you get to the middle, the more elaborate the colors are. Aaron is like that inside out. He has white garments close to him - underwear - and the further out you get the more colorful the clothing! He is basically walking around demonstrating the holy presence of God on his person. He is the tabernacle inside out. Aaron is kind of a cool guy because he brings the common people into the presence of God and he brings the presence of God to them! 

We’re not there yet, but look at Leviticus 16:4. It is talking about how Aaron is to enter the Most Holy Place. `“He is to put on the sacred linen tunic, with linen undergarments next to his body; he is to tie the linen sash around him ad put on the linen turban. “`

Aaron will only have on the white tunic and turban. The really elaborate stuff is not there. When Aaron does his regular duties in the tabernacle, he is representing an elaborate, majestic God to the people. But when Aaron goes into the Holy of Holies he is representing the common man to God. He is there without pretense, no fancy decorations, just a humble man asking for forgiveness. 

We actually have more information on what Aaron wears than anyone else in the Bible! This is just a guess at what Aaron would have worn. 

There is one last piece that the priest would wear and it is very unique. It is the Urim and Thummim. It was a couple of stones or dice, or tokens that would discern or judge the will of God. Their exact nature and function are not clearly defined in the Bible, but they are mentioned in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers. After the destruction of the first Temple,with the Babylonian exile, the Urim and Thummim are not mentioned in biblical text.

&nbsp;

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw a picture of what you think the priestly garments would look like. Do a Google search if you need to, or (better yet) just follow the instructions in Exodus!

# Day 3 &middot; _Sacrificial Colors_

This lesson is for all of my Learner friends! :)

`“These are a ___ of the things that were to come; the ___, however, is found in ___."` Colossians 2:17.

&nbsp;

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Let’s revisit the colors of the garments really quickly. 
Skimming back at Exodus 28, list all the colors you see. In Exodus 26:1 and 31, what colors were the tabernacle curtains? In Exodus 27:16, what colors were on the East side of the courtyard? I’m sensing a theme here. So what is significant about these colors?

&nbsp;

We’ve already talked briefly about the color gold. Gold is associated with God’s divinity, glory and purity. It represents the presence of God, His holiness, and His heavenly kingdom. It is frequently connected with royalty, wealth and the refinement of one’s character

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Besides all of these qualities, gold shines. It would add a shimmer to the fabric. Inside of the tabernacle, the light of the menorah would reflect off of the gold threads. 

If you are interested, you can purchase 24 K gold leaf thread for the low price of $400-1500 a skein. Now, mind you, this is gold leaf and not solid gold thread, so you’d have to slum it a little. 

To create this gold thread, the artisans needed to melt the gold and draw it through a series of successively smaller holes in a draw plate. It is known as wire drawing. This creates a smaller and smaller thread so it can be used as a thread. The process is extremely labor intensive as you will see in this video. Gold thread is now made with gold leaving over a fiber thread. Obviously it is much cheaper. It’s not for certain whether the Israelites made the gold threads, or took them from Egypt when they left.

&nbsp;

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you learn about gold?

&nbsp;

These gold threads would be used with a deep purple blue fabric, making look like a magical starry night over the heads of the priests as they worked. 

To get the blue fabric they would take these tiny snails from the Mediterranean Sea called a Murex snail. It would take tens of thousands of snails, and a lot of labor, to get the dye- so you can see that it was highly valuable. In this video you will see how this ancient practice was done. Let me tell you, I'm appreciating the artisan work that went into the tabernacle much MUCH more! (Note: You may want to skip the portion where the host’s wife has a segment…or not!)

They crushed and boiled the snail, and then applied it to the fabric. Depending on how many snails were used depended on the depth of the blue color.

&nbsp;

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you learn about blue? 

&nbsp;

Purple die was derived from a different species of snail. The extract process was similar. Each snail only yielded a drop or two of liquid. So imagine the quantity of snails they would need to dye the fabrics and curtains inside the tabernacle! These fabrics would have to be immersed in the liquid in order for it to be a uniform color. We have no idea how they did this, as the art has been lost for thousands of years. In this process, instead of killing the snail, they milked it. Um.. ok. I’m not sure how that works, but they could excrete drops of purple dye. In ancient times, only kings (and the High Priest) wore the color purple. The other priests wore plain white.

Scarlet dye was made from a particular worm called a Cermes vermilion. They have an interesting life cycle. The worm breaks the thin bark of twigs to suck 
the sap- from which it prepares a waxy scale to protect its soft body. The red dye is in this scale. When the female lays her eggs the larvae hatch and feed on the body of the worm. She gives her live for her children. Now get this. When she gives her life, it leaves a scarlet spot on the branch. But in three days, when that spot dries out, it changes to white and flakes off. 

Isaiah 1:18 says, `“Come now, let us reason together", says the LORD. "Though your sins are like _________ they shall be as _____ as snow; though they are 
____ as crimson, they shall be like ___."`

&nbsp;
# Day 4 &middot; _Ordination Ceremony_

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Exodus 29.

In order to be ordained the priests had to do certain things…and attending Bible college was not one of them. They had to wash themselves totally, total immersion like a baptism. They had to be anointed by oil. Sacrifices of animals were given seven days of it, and they were anointed or sprinkled with blood on their garments. I’m going to skim over the sacrifices a bit. 

Look, there is nothing beautiful about an animal sacrifice. I love animals and this is one of the hardest things for me to get through when reading the Bible. If we did worship like they did in the Old Testament, we'd have to slit the throat of an animal and let it bleed all over the stage. It’s gross. And it was intended to be that way. The entire point is that sin is destructive. It must be atoned for by blood…either yours or a sacrificial animal. But without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin. 

The priests didn’t just sacrifice the animal, they first put their hand on the animal’s head. What’s up with that? The idea was that they were transferring their guilt, their sin, onto the animal by the laying on of hands. They transfer their sin to the animal and the animal dies in their place. 

Exodus 29:14 “But burn the bull's flesh and its hide and its intestines &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; the camp. It is a &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; offering.” The sin offerings needed to be taken care of outside of the camp.

Hebrews 13:11-12 `“The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp. And so Jesus also suffering outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood."` Calvary was outside the City Gates. There is a direct line from the old covenant to the new covenant here.

&nbsp;

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you see Christ fulfilled in the function of the Old Testament priesthood? I mean, this is just a gross mess. But wait. Let's look at this a little closer. 

&nbsp;

In Exodus 29:20 they are going to take the ram and “Slaughter it, take some of its blood and put it on the lobes of the right ears of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of the right feet. Then splash blood against the sides of the altar.” I know you think I’ve probably lost my mind at this point, but stick with me. The act of slaughtering the ram (which is a male sheep) symbolized a total consecration to one’s life to God. 

Romans 12:1 `"Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a _____ _____, holy and pleasing to God- this is your true and proper worship.” `

But what do all these random body parts covered in blood mean? Well, I'm glad you asked! They are going to put blood on the lobe of the right ear, on the thumb of their right hand, and the big toe of the right foot. This priest is going to hear the word of God, do the work of God and walk in the ways of God before God's people. This is the idea of consecration. 

Blood is like the spiritual detergent and the priests have to be cleansed before they can participate in cleansing others. They have to deal with their own stuff first. We all have to deal with our own log before we can start surgery on others. If we’re not aware of our own sin, we’re not qualified to help others through theirs. 

Exodus 29:38 `“This is what you are to offer on the altar ____ each day: two lambs a year old.”`

Verse 42 `“For the ____ to come this burnt offering is to be made regularly at the entrance to the tent of meeting, before the LORD. There I will ___ you and ___ to you.”`

Once the tabernacle is built, the priests are consecrated and their ministry begins, every morning and every night a lamb will be sacrificed. When the day starts, we sacrifice. When the day ends, we sacrifice. It's all about God. It’s all about shedding blood. It's all about keeping a door open so they can approach God day and night. 

Thank God, that Jesus stopped the need for all of those sacrifices. Why, why did there need to be so much blood? Because no matter how many animals died, there would never be enough blood to cover the sins of all those people. Every time God looked at a lamb being sacrificed, He thought, “No, that’s not enough.” But when His Son willingly sacrificed His own life as the Lamb of God, heaven resounded, “YES! It’s enough!”

Hebrews 9:26, “But he [Christ] has appeared ___ and for ___ at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the ___ of ___.” Jesus completed the work. Nothing needs to be added to it. 

But what if you sin? 1 John 1:9 “If we ___ our sins, He is ___ and ___ and will ___ our sins and ___ us from all unrighteousness.” And read verse 10 "If we claim we have not sinned, we make Him out to be a ___ and His word is ___ in us.” 

Before they left Egypt, God said He would deliver them, they would be free, and He would dwell among them. “I will be your God and you will be my people.” And here they are, doing just that. Later on, the Children of Israel will be just going through the motions. In Isaiah 1:11 God says, “'The multitude of your sacrifices- what are they to me?’ Says the LORD.”

In Isaiah 1:13 He says, “Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations- I cannot bear your worthless assemblies.” 

The Israelites were still holding worship services. They were still going to church. They were ticking off all the boxes. But that’s all they were doing. Their hearts weren’t in it. If that’s you today, you're not alone. But please, please don't stay there. I hope you still have a hunger and thirst for Bible study. Apply the word to yourself- don't just listen to God’s word, DO it, WALK it! 

We can't lose sight of the purpose of all of this. They are building a temple so God can move into the neighborhood. They were preparing a place for 
_YHWH_. There's no point in making a pilgrimage (like other religions) to Mount Sinai - God is coming with them. They are going to take Him with them. What 
good news! God doesn't want to dwell in a place where we are not. They live in tents, so God is going to live in a tent... right in the center of town. This is how much God desires to be with us.

&nbsp;
# Day 5 &middot; _Washing and Worship_

Let’s recap and think about what it was like to be a Hebrew at that time. For the last 400 years they were subjected to Egypt’s gods and religious system. They had accepted it as how gods and religion worked. No wonder Yahweh had to be so precise and uncompromising with his instructions of what true worship looked like. God was giving them a step-by-step process of being separated from the ways of a corrupt world. 

While the Levites were the priestly tribe, not all Levites were priests. Some of them were. But all of the members of the tribe of Levi served the tabernacle in one form or another. Think of them as blue-collar laborers who did various tasks in the tabernacle: clean up, guard duty, moving men, etc. Whether a person was a priest or not was all determined by their family. 

As we look back on Exodus 29, we need to know that the consecration of the priests was public. This was not a secret ceremony. Also, I found it interesting that Aaron didn't really do anything, as much as it was done to him. For example: Moses washed Aaron. Moses dressed Aaron. Moses even did all the talking (ironically). 

What was the intention of Moses preparing the priests for service to Yahweh? Let's look at it in light of a similar incident in the New Testament. In the Gospel of John, Jesus washed the feet of his disciples. Jesus, the highest leader on earth, The Son of God, humbled Himself as a servant. What is the significance? This was the consecration ceremony for the new spiritual priesthood. Just as Moses acted on God’s behalf as the mediator, Jesus established the heavenly priesthood built on faith in Him. The disciples must have made the connection between Jesus washing their feet and Moses washing Aaron. The disciples were being commissioned to serve the spiritual kingdom of God. This is why we need to understand the Torah. It's a tragic mistake to say the Old Testament is of no value to believers. Especially because Jesus valued the Old Testament as truth. 

The ceremony of Moses washing the priests was a one-time deal. From here on out, each individual was charged with the washing himself. After being washed, Aaron and his sons put on the special priest clothing. Their old clothing represented who they were. But the new clothing represented who they were before God. Then they were anointed with special olive oil. The oil was literally poured all over them. It ran down their faces, dripped over their bears, and flowed to the hem of their garments. It was extremely messy. But here’s an interesting thing that is from Jewish tradition. When they poured the oil, they poured it over them from right to left, then back to front…the shape of the cross! This anointing oil was symbolic and prophetic of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit would come. 

The rituals performed in the Old Testament are always prophetic of the spiritual realities in the New Testament. They were copies and shadows of the future. They were absolutely real, but they played a much more important role in future events. 

&nbsp;

?> <i style='font-size: x-large' class="fa-solid fa-marker"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Exodus 30:1-10. 

&nbsp;

This chapter begins with God giving Moses instructions for the Altar of Incense (also known as the “golden altar”). Don't you love that God involved all the senses in the tabernacle? They smelled the incense, they tasted the sacrificial offerings, they felt the sacrificial blood on their hands, they saw the light of the menorah; and they heard the bells on their clothing. 

Burning incense (as well as sacrifice and prayer) was a common practice in Middle Eastern cultures of that day. So, what was going on? God was dealing with mankind in ways that they understood. He deals with us on our level. It would be absolutely impossible for God to deal with us on His level, as we could not begin to understand. God is laying out these guidelines for our benefit, not His. Although the practices may have looked the same, the reasons were significantly different. Pagan religious ceremonies revolved around appeasing and indulging a particular god. The Hebrew rituals were about following instructions that Yahweh laid down to benefit men. What we do in worship is not for God’s benefit- He does not need our worship. Our worship is for our benefit.

**How does worship benefit us?**

* It is an act of obedience. It is bending our will to the will of the Father’s. 
* It allows us to connect with God and foster a personal relationship with our Creator. 
* Engaging in worship gives us community and fellowship with other believers. 
* Worship offers us a time of reflection and contemplation. It offers us a space for expressing gratitude, seeking forgiveness and gives us peace. 
* Worship prepares our hearts for the teaching of God’s Word.

2 Chronicles 20:22 “`As they began to sing and praise, the Lord set ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Weir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated.”` (Sounds like another really good reason to sing and praise the Lord, right?)

With all these instructions from Yahweh, He was teaching His people a system of justice by which they could be redeemed and reconciled to God. He was teaching them about His value system. God was providing His people a way to commune with Him…and He was preparing them for a permanent reconciliation between God and man in the future.

The Altar of Incense was made out of acacia wood and overlaid with gold. It was approximately 18” square and 3’ high. An ornamental gold rim, like a crown, circled the top with golden “horns" on each corner. It stood before the veil that separated the Holy of Holies from the Holy Place.

A special incense was burned continuously on the Altar of Incense. When I did my lesson on the tabernacle, I ordered incense from Jerusalem that was a replica of the incense burned on this alter. The smoke of the incense represented the prayers of God's people. Aaron burned incense on the altar every morning, and at twilight, when he attended to the lamp stand. 

The Altar of Incense demonstrates when we come to God in prayer. It is always on His terms. We cannot come any way we like. 

_Torah_ (תּוֹרָה)<sup>[H8451](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8451/kjv/wlc/0-1/ "Strong's Number H8451")</sup> means _Teaching_ or _Instruction_. Everything the priests did was to teach the people some aspect of the kingdom of God. With this altar, God was teaching how to come to Him in prayer. (List the order in your workbook.)

First, must be cleansed by means of blood at the altar of sacrifice, just as the high priest had to be. We have to identify with what Jesus did for us at Calvary in order to be cleansed and commune with God. 

Second, we must be washed clean by means of water- as the high priest was in washing at the brazen laver. Christ said He is our Living Water. We must be washed before approaching Yahweh. Washing is symbolic of confessing and repenting of our sins. We need to leave our sins behind if we are to approach the Holy God. The brazen laver was lined with mirrors so the priests could see their reflection and check themselves as they washed. It’s a good thing to check ourselves before we come to worship. 

Next we enter the Holy Place. For Moses and the Israelites, the Holy Place was a tent. It would later become a wood and stone building called the Temple. Today, the holy place is within us. In fact, as believers, there is no place we can go where we are not in in His presence. So does that mean that we do not need to go to church for collective worship? Can we just go to the beach and hang out and call that “church?” 

Not according to Hebrews 10:25: `”Do not give up ____ together, as some are in the ___ of doing, but encouraging one another- and all the ___ as you see the Day approaching.”` 

Now, more than ever, we need to encourage each other to go to church for fellowship with other believers. Covid played a dirty trick on the church. It got people out of the habit of being in fellowship with other believers. I understand staying home when you are sick- but that is not what this verse is speaking about. This is a habit. It is habitual and a pattern in once’s life. 

Is there someone in your church that you need to encourage to come back into fellowship? Write their name and something you can do this week to encourage them.

Listen, God doesn’t let us just “wing it” when it comes to worshipping. The worship that God accepts is the worship that God prescribes. He doesn’t let people say, “Well, I think it would be ok if I just worshipped like this…” The worship that God accepts is not the worship that man invents. 

When Jesus went tot Samaria a woman came to him and basically said, “What's the big deal? Our Father’s worship right here on this mountain. You Jews say Jerusalem is the place to worship.” You can’t make up your own system. 

In John 4:23, Jesus said, `“Yet a time is coming and now come when the ___ worshipers will worship the Father in ___ and in ___, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.”`

This is the idea that most people have…”Any way is ok. You have your way. I have my way. All paths lead to God.” This is fascinating because they do not buy this philosophy in other areas of their lives. If you had paralysis on your left side, what if your doctor said, “Oh, just go home and follow your heart. When it comes to your condition, just go with the flow. Find your own path. All paths lead to health and healing. It really doesn’t matter as long as you are sincere. Just believe in yourself.”

The crazy thing is that in our culture, if you believe in a single truth, you are labeled “intolerant.” But the fact still remains: worship that God accepts is the worship that God prescribes. 

Proverbs 4:12 `“There is a way that appears to be ___, but in the end it leads to ___.”` You certainly can pick your own way. You can choose your own adventure. It just ends up in death - eternal death.
