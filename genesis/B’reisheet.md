“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” 

- Genesis 1:1
```

Read [Genesis 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&version=CJB)

The first chapter of Genesis tells of the creation of the universe. How is that similar or 
different to what is commonly taught today in public schools?

We are going to meet God in this chapter and He will reveal Himself to us through this 
study. The Bible is intentionally teaching God’s people about who God is, and how He 
interacts with us. 

Word Study: Go to www.blueletterbible.org. Type in Genesis 1. As you read through the 
scripture, look for key words that you want to study. For example, if you wanted to define 
“God” in Genesis 1:1 (In the beginning God…) click on the tools menu to the left of the 
verse. Look at the word “God.” You will see it is the Hebrew word Elohim. There is a 
Strong’s Concordance reference number of H430. Click on that. You will see that it is a 
plural word for word gods (ordinary H433) - but in this verse it is specifically used of the 
supreme God.

On the seventh day God \__________. (Vs 2) Why did God “rest” on the seventh day. Do you 
think He was tired? 

---

God did some different things when He made man than when He created the rest of 
creation. Vs. 7 “Then the LORD God formed the man out of the 
&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; from the 
&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and 
&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; the 
&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; of 
&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;
into his nostrils. 

According to www.blueletterbible.org, what is *“the breath”* of life?

---

God is breathing His own unique kind of life into mankind. In other places in the Bible, 
ruakh is used for breath, but this is not that kind of breath. This word “breath” is 
neshamah, or “breath of life.” This is vital breath of divine inspiration. It is our soul and 
spirit. This breath is specifically described as God’s gift of life to us. 

God got his hands dirty when he formed man. All creation was created by the sound of His 
voice. But for man, he took the time to mold him and make him with His own hands. 

What does that say about God’s relationship to you?

---

There were two specific trees planted in the middle of the garden: The tree of life and the 
tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The tree of life must have been something that 
Adam was able to eat from ([Gen 2:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A16&version=CJB)) …and will become available to us once again in the 
New Jerusalem ([Rev. 22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+22&version=CJB)), but not the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This tree seems to be a one-of-a-kind tree. This tree served as a symbol of 

1. humanity’s choice to trust God’s definition of what is good and bad, and 
2. humanity’s choice to seize autonomy and define good and bad for themselves. This is the first instance of God allowing his 
creation to disobey.

> Note: God had not created Eve yet. When God tells Adam to not eat of this tree, it is solely 
his responsibility. 

Thoughts?

---

Obedience should have been a piece of cake! There were so many “yeses” … and only one 
“no.” And that one “no” carried with it a hard consequence: death. God did not intend for
his creation to experience death, disease, or danger. God made it very clear what the cost 
would be for disobedience. (Adam would not drop dead the minute he tasted that fruit…but 
his relationship with God was immediately cut off.) This death of sin was both physical and 
spiritual. 

God created man from dirt. Vs. 19 says “The LORD God formed out of the __________ every 
wild animal and every bird of the sky.” He used the same basic building material- but He did 
NOT use animals to create man. Our origin is different than modern evolution classes may 
propose. 

God also created a special garden for the man and his wife. This was a separate place within 
creation. God tended this garden personally with all the plants and life forms that He had 
already created. 

According to [verses 8-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A8-14&version=CJB), what other things did God place in this garden?

Read [Genesis 2:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A15&version=CJB). What did God tell Adam to do?

There was only one thing in creation that was “not good.” Repeatedly we hear that God 
created and it was good. But something was incomplete…man.

The chapter ends with a wedding! *“They become one flesh.”* vs. 24 

…and they lived happily ever after…or did they?

&nbsp;
# Day 3 &middot; _First Site of Salvation_

Chapter two left us off with birds chirping and Adam and Eve’s wedding day! What a great 
end. They had a clean record. Verse 25 says they were “not ashamed.” I really wanted Adam 
and Eve to sail off into the sunset and never have a care in the world. Now those of you who 
are married will understand that the real work begins after the wedding. And so it is with 
Adam and Eve. 

Read [Genesis 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3&version=CJB)

Chapter three is a shock! Here, their beautiful happily ever after comes crashing down 
around them. As of right now, there is perfect peace on the earth. Lions lay down with 
lambs, there is no death, disease or danger. Adam is about to change all that.

When Eve spoke with Satan in the garden of Eden she both added and subtracted from

Woman:

Man:

Why do you think satan approached Eve with his lies and not Adam? Adam was the head of 
all creation. To corrupt him would corrupt all of creation. Satan overturns the created order. 
He removes Adam from the headship and replaces him with Eve.

# Day 4 &middot; _R-E-S-P-E-C-T_

Read [Genesis 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+4&version=CJB)

Adam and Eve have left the garden. They are living a very different life. Everything has 
changed. Animals have become hostile to them, and each other. Weeds and thorns are 
growing. But there is something far worse… suffering and death have been introduced. 
Cain and Abel were brothers. A problem arose in their relationship and God accepted only 
Abel’s sacrifice. This is the first time we’ve seen the concept of jealousy and murder in 
Scripture. 

The first animal sacrifice was performed by God Himself in the last chapter. Now, Adam and 
Eve must follow that example- the life of an innocent animal is now required. Fruits and 
vegetables won’t be enough. 

Two sons were born to Adam and Eve. There, most likely were many more children, but we 
will focus on the two brothers. Cain was a farmer and Abel was a shepherd. These are two 
of the oldest professions. 

It was understood by the family that God desired a sacrifice offering. Cain brought the land’s 
produce. This seemed like a legitimate act of worship on Cain’s part. The problem is that 
Cain didn’t get to make the rules about what offerings are acceptable to God. (And neither 
do we.) Cain knew what God wanted, but he ignored God’s command and instead brought 
what **he** wanted. 

Abel brought something more distinct. Fill in the blanks for verse 4: “And Abel also 
presented an offering - some of the _________________- of his flock and their ________ 
portions.” This was a generous gift. He gave God the best, the first, the most choice. And 
the Lord regarded that. 

#### Word Study

| Word | Strong’s Verse | Hebrew | <div style="width:490px">Definition</div> |
| ----- | -------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Respect | H3068 | Gen 4:4 |    |  |

The LORD looked at Abel’s sacrifice and respected it. But God didn’t respect Cain’s offering. 
Verse 5b “… Cain was _________, and he looked ______________.”

Cain didn’t get his own way. He decided not to get a sacrificial animal. Perhaps it was 
inconvenient to find one, or trade for one. But whatever the reason, Cain was hostile toward 
God. God was warning Cain that mankind does not have the right to enter His presence on 
his own terms. He chose to put his faith in his own efforts and plans rather than God’s law. 

Do you know someone that reminds you of Abel? Of Cain? _____________________________
Why do you think Cain rejected God’s plan for sacrifice? Why did Abel obey? _____________ 
__________________________________________________________________________________

In your opinion, was God’s response to Cain too harsh? Why or why not? ________________ 
__________________________________________________________________________________

What should Cain have done? _______________________________________________________
Cain had the opportunity to receive God’s grace when he brought the wrong sacrifice…but 
he rejected the opportunity. God still warns us today with the same message: turn away 
from your stubbornness and repent of your anger or sin will destroy you. 

We all have two choices: serve Jesus Christ or serve the devil. There is no in-between. 
God insists that there is only one way to salvation. What do you think of that? ____________ 
__________________________________________________________________________________

Cain murdered his brother. Why? 1 John 3:12 says, “Do not be like _______, who beloved to 
the ________ one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own 
____________ were evil and his brother’s were ________________.”

In Genesis 4:9 God asks Cain a question. Write it here: 
__________________________________________________________________________________

He knows exactly where his brother is. There it is. The moment when Cain could have 
confessed his sin and would have been restored to God. Yes, even after murdering his 
brother. But he just couldn’t do it. He had to get snarky with God. 

How does Cain respond? 
__________________________________________________________________________________ 

You can feel the sadness in God’s voice when He responds to Cain, “Your brother’s blood 
cries out to me from the ground!” 

Vs. 16 “Then Cain _______ ________ from the LORD’s ______________ and lived in the land 
of Nod, east of Eden.” 

Look up the meaning of the word “Nod” in verse 16. What does it mean literally, and how 
do you think it applies to this story? _________________________________________________

What a tragedy! This verse suggests that Cain never again entered the presence of God. All 
because he was too proud to say, “I sinned. I’m sorry. Please forgive me.” In a symbolic 
sense it it the same for us. We are separated from God, in a state of wandering and unrest. 
The only rest that exists for humanity is when we are in God’s presence. Why would we 
ever forsake that? 

Two family lines. 

1. Cain’s murderous ways infect his family line. By the time we get to his great-great-greatgrandson, we find a man bragging about his own violence. “I killed a man for wounding me,” 
Lamech boasts (4:23). Lamech killed a man for just injuring him. Note that Lamech is 
speaking to his wives! In just four chapters God’s perfectly designed creation is reveling in 
bloodshed and ignoring His design for marriage! No wonder we are having issues in our 
culture today! Sin is never a cause for bragging, it causes only God’s wrath and judgment. 

2. In the place of Abel, God granted Eve another son named Seth (4:25). Let’s look at 4:26b. 
“At that time people began to call on the name of the LORD.” Hundreds of years later, Noah 
would come from Seth’s line (5:28-32). 

Cain’s sin was insisting on entering God’s presence on his own terms. He knew that God 
demanded an animal sacrifice, but he brought something inferior, something easy, 
something convenient for him to bring. 

This scenario is going to be the representation of God’s atonement for the sins of mankind. 
The shedding of blood of an innocent lamb was required. 

We see Cain’s spirit still at work today. The world teaches there are many paths to God. It 
teaches that you have your own truth and don’t need to adhere to God’s truth. The world, 
like Cain, sets its own interests above those of family and God. 

We look at God’s rejection of Cain and may think, “Wow, that’s too harsh. After all, it’s 
what’s in the heart that matters, right?” But Cain’s heart was not in the right place. He 
thought he could make the rules for himself, and not even God could dictate how he was 
going to live. Big mistake.

Cain’s name will forever be associated with evil and wickedness.

# Day 5 &middot; _Compensation_

Read [Genesis 5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+5&version=CJB)

The first humans and their first children were shown by God Himself that the consequences 
of sin carries a high price; and that price is death. In God’s great mercy he will allow (for a 
time) the blood of an innocent animal to cover (atone) for man’s sin. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Atonement**: *To cover, purge, to coat or cover over*

Atonement covers our sin. Oh, the sin is still there. It’s just covered up like fig leaves 
covered Adam and Eve’s nakedness. The blood of animals would serve as a spiritual 
atonement (covering). The skin of the animal would serve to physically cover our 
nakedness, but at the same time provide a visual illustration of what is happening in the 
spiritual realm. God would allow this plan of redemption until Christ comes. Unlike the 
blood of animals, the Messiah’s blood didn’t only cover the sin, it nullified it and sent it far 
away! 

Adam and Eve had a son in place of Abel. His name was Seth. What does the name “Seth” 
mean? (www.blueletterbible.org)

---

A compensation is a prayer or hope that is granted. 

> A note about genealogies. It is a basic form of biblical history telling. It shoes how one 
generation expends its influence and abilities or how history continues through the 
centuries from one generation to another. 

Noah came from Seth’s line. Noah’s father was Lamech. This is NOT the same Lamech that 
was fifth in line from Cain. Just like today when there are thousands, if not millions, of 
people who have the same name (James, Mary, etc.) Lots of people had the same name too. 
We need to be careful when reading the Bible not to mix people up just because they have 
the same name. 

Chapter 5 ends with the birth of the 3 sons of Noah. Write their names: 

&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;,
&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;,
&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;

Noah most likely had many other children. After all, he was precisely 500 years old when he 
had these sons. But these three boys were set-apart, elected, special.

Read [Genesis 6:1-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+6%3A1-8&version=CJB)

The first two verses are some of the most mysterious in the Bible. Verse 2, “the _________ of 
_________ saw that the _______________ of __________________ were beautiful, and they 
took any they chose as wives for themselves. 

Vs. 4: “The _____________ were on the earth both in those days and afterward… They were 
the powerful men of old, the _____________ men.” 

We will see more references to these “sons of God” later. For now, they were were probably 
some kind of high-ranking spiritual being. They were not angels. The Bible also gives us a 
special name for them, “Nefilim” (nee-fee-leem). The King James Bible has translated 
Nefilim to mean “giants”… yes, like “fee-fi-foe-fum.” The Hebrew word Nefilim is a play on 
the root word, “nephal” which means “fallen” or “to fall upon.” I had the sense of being 
“cast down”. Martin Luther described the nature of the Nefilim as men of violence, tyrants. 
They were bigger, stronger, smarter, and probably the subjects of pagan myths and legends. 

```
“And the LORD said, ‘My _______________ will not remain with mankind forever 
because they are corrupt.’ Their days on earth will be ____________ years.” 

- Genesis 6:3 
```

There’s that word “spirit” again. This is God’s ruakh. God’s spirit will not abide with 
humans forever. Living creatures have borrowed ruakh (breath)- the invisible life-energy 
that sustains their existence. When they die, their ruakh (spirit/ breath) will go back to the 
Creator. 

Man will live more than 120 years, as we know from history. It must be not how long the 
human body was designed to live but about God pronouncing that the Flood would 
commence in 120 more years, wiping out all mankind…all except Noah and his family. 
God is going to teach us another aspect about Himself. He will not destroy the faithful along 
with the wicked. Do bad things happen to good people? Yes. But it is not at the hand of 
God. It is from the evil one. God doesn’t promise believers shelter from persecution or 
wicked people. But these things will come at the hand of evil men, not HIM. What God does 
promise is to not shower His own wrath, His divine judgment, upon the godly along with 
the godless. This is important to grasp, especially in light of the Tribulation. The Tribulation 
period is men pouring out evil on other men at an unprecedented level. God’s wrath is 
brought about supernaturally

# Shadows of the Messiah

A shadow is an outline without the details filled in. It is real. It is not an optical illusion. But 
it is less real than the object that casts the shadow. When you stand in the sun you cast a 
shadow. You are real, and so is the shadow. But you are the source of the shadow. You are 
the complete original and the shadow is a representation of you …but incomplete as the 
details are left out. The shadow has no power in itself, and it must stay in lockstep with you, 
as it is 100% dependent on your existence. You can still exist and not have a shadow. But if 
you cease to exist, it is impossible to have a shadow. You are greater than your shadow. 

Where can you see a foreshadowing of Jesus the Messiah from Genesis 1:1-6:8?
