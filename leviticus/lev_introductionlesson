The Book of _Leviticus_

&nbsp;

What is your favorite book of the Bible? 

What is your favorite verse in the Bible? 

Ask 100 Christians what their favorite Bible book and verse are, and you may be hard-pressed for anyone to say something in Leviticus! There are not a lot of pastors who preach from this book, although there are a few! Flip through your Bible in the book of Leviticus. Do you have any highlights? Some of you might! But most of you won’t have many…at least not yet (smile). 

Leviticus might not be a favorite book of the Bible, but it has some precious truths. Several years ago, we did a Bible study going through the Bible in a year. I was nervous about how people would take Leviticus when we got there, but it was my favorite book … I know, crazy, huh? But I am so excited to share with you what I learned! 

This is our third book together. I loved opening Genesis with you and learning about the creation of the world, the first family, and the call of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. Then, we explored Exodus with its twists and turns. Under the leadership of Moses, we followed the Israelites from captivity to freedom. In Genesis, we see man ruined. In Exodus, we see man redeemed. In Leviticus, we see man worshiping God. 

In our culture, “inclusion” is of utmost importance. Our culture defines inclusion as consensus, conformity, and tolerance. And if we’ve learned anything from Genesis and Exodus, God did more dividing, electing, and separating than being tolerant and inclusive. He divided the light from darkness, good from evil, truth from deception, order from chaos, and Israel from all other nations. As we study the sacrificial system, we see the same divisions: clean and unclean, holy and profane, and priestly and common. God does not tolerate unacceptable behavior. 

We are going to get a priestly worldview from Leviticus. Why is that important? 

```
“1 Peter 2:9 tells us: "But you are a ___ people, a royal ___, a ___ nation, God's special ___, that you may declare the ___ of Him who called you out of the ___ into his wonderful ___.” 
```

But what does being a priest entail? Is it just a cool title? Or could there be something more? Maybe it’s a good idea to find out. Let’s see what God expects of the priests…and us. (Remember, this is a shadow—God is looking at us in a spiritual realm, not an earthly one.)
And now we get to Leviticus. You may read this book and think, what happened to the adventure and action? This book is…dare I say it… gross. 
2 Timothy 3:16 All Scripture is _____-__________ and is useful for ____________________, _________________, _____________________ and _________________ in righteousness. 
All Scripture. Even Leviticus? Yes, even Leviticus! Look. He wouldn’t have put it there if God didn't want it there. There are lessons for us to learn! 
First and foremost, the ancient Jews began training their children in the law of God using the Leviticus book. They didn’t first learn about God from Psalms, and certainly not the New Testament (Note: It wasn’t around yet. Ha!). Why? Because they believed that children were pure and sacrifices were pure. So, those who are pure should think about pure things. This was the center of their lives, the center of their communities, and the center of their spiritual lives. 
The pages of Leviticus will help us better understand God’s ordained sacrificial system and develop a deeper appreciation for what Christ did for us. I hope that as you study, you will see how amazing and wonderful God’s plan of redemption is for us. 
Here’s a fun fact: the New Testament quotes and alludes to the book of Leviticus more than 100 times! Crazy, huh? See if you can find any familiar verses you may have read in the New Testament as we read! So, again, if Jesus and the New Testament writers are quoting this book, let’s find out what all the commotion is about. 
This book is divided into two themes: sacrifice (chapters 1-17) and Sanctification (chapters 18-27). Sacrifice is an event, while sanctification is a process. We walk with God throughout our entire lifetimes. Jesus sacrificed Himself at Calvary. He died for our sins. That’s the event, sacrifice. But then we dedicate our lives to Him after the event; that’s sanctification. 
We can all agree that being in God’s presence is good. We even say that God is good all the time, and all the time, God is good! And that’s true! But it’s also dangerous to be in God’s presence. Animals are killed to get people into God’s presence. Blood is shed for that to happen. The high priest enters God’s presence in the Holy of Holies once a year, very carefully, lest he is killed. 
The sun is good, right?! It helps things grow, gives us vitamin D, and helps us see…all good stuff. But you could die if you decided to move closer to the sun. You would burn up. You couldn’t even get within 3,000,000 (yes, that’s 3 million) miles of the sun because the air temperature is 248 degrees F. You’d burst into flames. 
It’s kind of like that with God. God’s holiness and presence are excellent, but if you were to get too close, you wouldn’t be able to handle it. Leviticus will teach us how dangerous Yahweh is, how vast the distance between God and man is…and how remarkable it is that such a distance can be spanned in the person of the Messiah! 
Exodus 33:18 Then Moses said, “Now show me your ______________. The LORD said that He would cause all His goodness to pass in front of Moses, but Moses would not be able to see His face. No one could see Him and live. Leviticus provided the solution: Y… you need a sacrifice. And one day, we, too, will behold Him face to face because of the blood of Jesus! 
The book of Leviticus has a lot of blood. A LOT of blood. And it’s meant to teach us the same thing it taught the Israelites: sin is gross. It’s destructive. It’s a bloody mess. There is nothing pleasant about it. But everyone has sinned. (Romans 3:23)
We like to think of sin as gross in other people but not so bad in us. I mean, we’re not as bad as “those” people…it was just a “little white lie.” But that’s not how God sees it.  
Romans 6:23: “For the wages of sin is ___________, but the _______________ of God is eternal __________ in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
There is a price to be paid. So, the people must go to the priest with their offering. The sinner will slaughter that animal. The animal was taking the place of the person who sinned. The wages of sin is death. 
Let’s just set the stage for where the children of Israel are right now. Shortly after the Israelite’s exodus from Egypt, they traveled through the wilderness and arrived at Mount Sinai, where they camped and received the laws and instructions from God. They are still at the foot of Mount Sinai in the wilderness. This book both opens and closes at the foot of Mount Sinai. God is instructing them while they are in their camp. 

In Exodus 40:35, where is Moses? 
	___ inside the tent of meeting     ___ outside the tent of meeting
In this holy tent, humans can meet with God. But in Numbers 1:1, where is Moses? 
	___ inside the tent of meeting     ___ outside the tent of meeting
What is happening here? Moses is the representative of Israel. How did he go from being outside the tabernacle to inside it? Leviticus is going to answer that question! It will also answer the question, “How do I approach God?” And “What does it mean to be holy?”
Leviticus bridges our need for restoration and the relationship between humans and God. It is not just a book about laws and rituals (although there are plenty of those), but it is the story of God’s desire to repair His relationship with Israel so they can live as His people.
