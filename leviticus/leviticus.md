*The Book of Leviticus*

The Book of Leviticus (/lɪˈvɪtɪkəs/, from Ancient Greek: Λευιτικόν, Leuïtikón; Hebrew: וַיִּקְרָא, Vayyīqrāʾ, "And He called") is the third book of the Torah (the Pentateuch) and of the Old Testament, also known as the Third Book of Moses.[1] Scholars generally agree that it developed over a long period of time, reaching its present form during the Persian Period, from 538–332 BC.

Most of its chapters (1–7, 11–27) consist of Yahweh's speeches to Moses, which Yahweh tells Moses to repeat to the Israelites. This takes place within the story of the Israelites' Exodus after they escaped Egypt and reached Mount Sinai (Exodus 19:1). The Book of Exodus narrates how Moses led the Israelites in building the Tabernacle (Exodus 35–40) with God's instructions (Exodus 25–31). In Leviticus, God tells the Israelites and their priests, Aaron and his sons, how to make offerings in the Tabernacle and how to conduct themselves while camped around the holy tent sanctuary. Leviticus takes place during the month or month-and-a-half between the completion of the Tabernacle (Exodus 40:17) and the Israelites' departure from Sinai (Numbers 1:1, 10:11).

The instructions of Leviticus emphasize ritual, legal, and moral practices rather than beliefs. Nevertheless, they reflect the world view of the creation story in Genesis 1 that God wishes to live with humans. The book teaches that faithful performance of the sanctuary rituals can make that possible, so long as the people avoid sin and impurity whenever possible. The rituals, especially the sin and guilt offerings, provide the means to gain forgiveness for sins (Leviticus 4–5) and purification from impurities (Leviticus 11–16) so that God can continue to live in the Tabernacle in the midst of the people.[2]

#### _Introduction_

Why Study Leviticus? 

Good question! I'm glad you asked. 
What is the most important thing in the world? Is it happiness? No, it’s holiness. True happiness begins with holiness. 
```
“Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be ---; without --- no one will see the Lord.” (Hebrews 12:14 NIV)
```
Here’s the thing: we want God to solve all our problems, heal our sickness, and carry our burdens, but we don’t want Him to control our lives. 

This book, in its entirety, is spoken by God. And, in His own words, God mentions the word “holy” 67 times in this book. That’s a lot of times. Maybe we should pay attention to that. 

The word “holy” in Hebrew is “kodesh.” It means “set apart, separate, hallowed, consecrated, dedicated.” The Sabbath was holy, the priests were holy, the priests' clothing was holy, the tithe was holy, and anything God called “Holy” had to be treated differently from the everyday things of life. We are a holy priesthood. (We’re going to find out what that means!) And note that the requirements of holiness are uncompromising. Near misses do not count. 

1—Leviticus unlocks the other books of the Bible. For example, we must fully understand the book of Hebrews with a working knowledge of Leviticus. The writer of Hebrews assumes you know this ancient text. So, when that book refers to the priesthood and sacrifices, it means that you understand this book. 

2—Leviticus will unveil God's presence. Leviticus will be very straightforward: God wants to invade your space—all of it. He doesn’t want just Sundays. He wants everything: from personal hygiene to worship, your daily experiences… all of you. Sheesh! God wants everything?! Yes. 

3- It will show us important patterns of worship. Most believers experience a shallow worship service. Sometimes, the worship can become canned, just going through the motions, with no real engagement on the part of the worshippers. Leviticus will show us that God wants you entirely and totally into the worship experience. Worship is dynamic and active. It is not passive. 

4- Leviticus underscores God’s holiness. Again, this word has been watered down through the years. We will learn how holy God is and how unapproachable He is because of our sins unless something bridges the gap. The Hebrew word “holy” or “holiness, sanctify, sanctification” is Kodesh. It appears in this book 97 times. The word “atonement,” meaning “cover up, " appears 50 times in Leviticus. The blood of bulls and goats didn’t take away sin but covered it over until Christ came to take away all sins by the sacrifice of His life.  I think God may want us to pay attention to these words! 

5- Jesus Christ was the fulfillment of the sacrificial system of Leviticus. We’ve all heard that Jesus died for our sins. It has been repeated in many pulpits and worship songs over and over. However, we cannot fully understand the meaning of the prophetic shadow of Christ’s work, comprehend a need for it, know its meaning, or experience the impact of Jesus’ sacrifice until we understand Leviticus. Without this book, we have only a shallow and simple understanding. We will explore what it meant for Yeshua to make perfect God’s principles of sacrifice.

#### _How To Do This Study_

This is an in-depth, 11-week Bible study. Leviticus: Shadows of the Messiah contains five daily lessons each week. Each lesson requires about 30 minutes, and their completion is crucial. Each day’s lessons consist of reading and learning activities in the form of this workbook. These will help you reap the full benefit of the study.  Please do not omit them. They will contribute to your solidifying and digesting important spiritual truths. We will listen to and take notes on Pastor Joe’s message each week. You can either come to Son Light Christian Center in Orange, California (where Pastor Joe preaches) at 10 AM, watch online, or catch the YouTube replay starting on Mondays. bit.ly/sonlightsermons. 

We will meet on Monday nights to discuss what we learned. By then, you should have completed the weekly lessons and taken notes on the sermon. Please be prepared to share what you have learned. Feel free to research more and dig deeper! We are so excited to study God’s Word with you this year! Take notes on what you have learned, any “ah-ha” moments, or questions you may have. We will discuss them all during our Bible study. 
There will be some sections where you are asked to think about something. Take a moment and ponder what the question is asking you. You will find the Bible study portion at https://www.rockyour.bible/.

There are a few ways you can experience this Bible study: in a group Bible study, Sunday School class, or any other small group gathering, or you may choose to study the content on your own. Either way, the videos are there for you to use at any time. Record your best takeaway from each day to share with the group weekly.

Group Study

As a group study, you will watch Pastor Joe’s sermon at the beginning of your week, take notes (links included), and then do the daily work for five days. When you meet as a group, pray and ask God to speak to you as you dive in. Make sure to record prayer requests and praises for the week. Discuss your takeaways from the sermon and each day of the study. What did you learn new? What questions do you still have? As the group leader, please list questions to help your group reflect on the material and how it applies to your lives.  We end each session by discussing how you have seen shadows of the Messiah in your lessons. 

By the time your group meets, you should have completed the weekly lessons and have taken notes on the sermon. Please be prepared to share what you have learned. Feel free to research more and dig deeper! We are so excited to study God’s Word with you this year! 

Personal Study

This study is designed for personal reflection. Go at your own pace. Spend time with God in prayer and listen to what He may be saying to you. 

Torah Portions

Torah portions organize this study. The first five books of the Bible are known as the Torah or the Pentateuch. They are divided into 54 portions, each named for the passage's first words. Each week, a Torah portion is read aloud or chanted from the Torah scroll during the synagogue on Shabbat. Each portion is identical to the order and section that Jesus would have learned from and taught from.
