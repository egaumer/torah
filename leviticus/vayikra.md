# Vayikra


The Cloud of Glory, previously on the top of Mount Sinai, has come down and filled the Tent of Meeting. God calls Moses to give him the laws of the sacrifices. Those desiring to draw near to God are told to bring a gift. 

In Judaism today, the book of Leviticus is called “Vayikra,” which means “and He called.” It is taken from Leviticus 1:1. Write that verse down.

In Matthew 16:18, Jesus tells Peter, “And on this rock, I will build my ________, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.” 

The word “church” is ekklēsia. It means “called out.” This message is for us!

On almost every page of this book, God is the direct speaker. The fact that God imparted these laws to Moses is mentioned 56 times in 27 chapters! This book is made up almost entirely of the very words of God…more than any other book of the Bible! 
Leviticus will reveal God's character—and God has not changed. It will also teach us the awfulness of sin and God’s graciousness. It will also introduce us to the sacrifice of Christ and what that means to us. This book will teach us what it truly means to worship the LORD. Are you ready?

# Day 1 &middot; _Worship is Active (The Burnt Offering)_

<span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Leviticus 1.

Millions of people create a New Year’s Resolution every year on New Year's Eve. Did you make one this year? What was it?

A lot of Christians make a resolution to read through the Bible in a year. When they start, it’s great! Genesis is all about beginnings: the beginning of the world, the first family, the first murder, the first city, the first covenant… Wow! It's all good and exciting. Then, Exodus comes on the scene with the themes of freedom and redemption. The Israelites go from the first family to the first nation. They are freed from slavery by miracles of God. They find freedom to worship and journey to the Promised Land. So exciting. But then the “Bible In A Year” hits the book of Leviticus. You have to think, “What is happening here?” Read Leviticus 1.

The offerings given to the Lord in this time were not like those in churches today—when we drop some money into the offering plate as a token of our love for God. Their offerings were time-consuming, significant, bloody, and very, very messy. How does this apply to our lives? We live in a different culture. PETA would advocate for a “Meatless Monday” movement for the entire Israelite community. They might even try to convince the priests of a plant-based offering.

In ancient times, Jewish children began their study of the Bible with the book of Leviticus. It was literally the first book they read! Let that sink in…

As we read this book, we’re not going to get the same “feel-good feels” we get from books like Psalms, Matthew, or John. We’re going to have to dig a little deeper. But precious jewels are worth mining for! So, please put on your mining caps, and let’s begin. 

Something interesting about this book is that nobody moves in it geographically. It opens and closes with the Israelites in the same spot, at Mt. Sinai. Moses has come down from the mountain after having an incredible, personal, holy, and overwhelming worship experience to find God’s people worshiping a golden calf. He loses his mind, becomes angry, smashes the tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written, grinds that golden calf into a de-calf latte, and makes the people drink it.  Then he goes back up the mountain again. He gets a second copy of the law, renews the covenant, and the cloud of God’s shekinah (the presence of God in a place) glory settles over the camp so the people know that God is present. This is where Leviticus begins and ends. 

We call this book “Leviticus,” but the Hebrews called it Vayikra. Does that name sound familiar? It’s the name of this chapter. It means, “And He spoke.” It is the first phrase from this book in verse 1. The Complete Jewish Bible says, "Adonai called to Moshe and spoke to him from the tent of meeting.” We call the book Leviticus after the tribe of Levi, who were the priests. This was the third time that the Torah says God called Moses. (1- Burning bush in Exodus 3, 2- from the midst of the cloud on Mount Sinai in Exodus 19, and 3- here at the beginning of Leviticus.)

The burnt offering of Leviticus 1 is called “‘olah” in Hebrew. It means “that which goes up.” What is going up is smoke.  The offering to the Lord is burned up with a fire on the altar. It emits smoke, which rises to God in heaven. This offering in Chapter 1 is personal: it was made by individuals as opposed to burnt offerings made on behalf of the nation of Israel. 

This offering is completely consumed, totally burned. It all goes to ashes, except for the animal's hide (verse 6). The priests used the hide to make leather goods, clothing, belts, sandals, etc., as part of their compensation. 

In Leviticus 1, what different animals are given as sacrifices? 

What is the reason for so many different animals? There are so many different options. The reason is that the people have varying financial abilities. Somebody with a lot of money can offer a cow. But for someone else, that offering could completely bankrupt them. They may not even have the means to own a cow. So everyone, from the most wealthy to the poorest, can have an offering. 

```
“If the offering is a burnt offering from the ___, you are to offer a ___ without ___.” (Leviticus 1:3 NIV)
```
What similaritites do you see with verses 3 and 10? 

The animals given to God needed to be healthy. They were to give their best to God. Let me put it this way: they were to give their best worship to God. 

God understands our tendency to find something we’re not using anymore and give that. We think, “Well, this cow has a broken leg. I can’t use it for anything, so I’ll give that one to God.” And don’t we do that today? Who hasn’t sat in church and thought, “The music is too loud. Or, it’s not loud enough—someone might hear me singing. I’ll clap, but I won’t sing. I’ll give my worship, but it won’t be whole-hearted. What would people think if I stood up, raised my hands, or went to the altar?” 

God said, “Um, no. That won’t do. You need to bring a male and one without a blemish.” God was not being gender-neutral. He also didn’t explain why it had to be a male or a female (in other cases). We’re just told what they were to do. 

```
“When you offer blind animals for sacrifice, is that not ___? When you sacrifice ___ or ___ animaals, is that not ___? Try offering them to your ___! Would he be pleased with you? Would he accept you? Says the LORD Almighty.” (Malachi 1:8 NIV)
```
Your sacrifice is to be the best. It is to have no blemishes. 

Throughout this whole chapter, the reference is made to “you.” You are to offer a male without defect, you must present it, you are to lay your hand on the head, you are to slaughter the bull, you are to skin it and cut it into pieces… Who is you? Look back at verse 2. Who is the “you” that is doing all these things? 

The worshiper is the one who comes with his own knife to the sacrifice. They must kill their own animal and cut it to pieces before the priest. The priest will take it from there, sprinkle the blood, lay out the parts on the altar, etc. 

When we visualize this scene, the common man (not the priest) performs most of the duties, with the priest officiating. We must realize how passive and sterile our church has become in our worship. Our involvement in worship and seeking forgiveness is reduced to just showing up…and sometimes not even on time or in person. This was not God’s plan. The worshiper was an active participant in worship. The worshiper is all in. 
He is totally committed in two ways: 1) It will cost him something. Worship must cost us something: our time, talent, treasure…it’s costly. It costs our best, not our leftovers. 

In 2 Samuel 24, David went to buy some property from a man named Araunah to build the temple. Of course, when Araunah saw that the king wanted the land, he offered it for free. He even wanted to throw in some oxen for the burnt offering. But David wouldn’t have it. What did he say to Araunah in verse 24? 

There was no way he would offer something to God that cost nothing. What does worship cost you? 

When they laid their hand on the head of the animal, this act acknowledged that this particular animal was being sacrificed. At that moment, the animal's life was turned over to God. The Bible also refers to “laying on of hands” to a person in authority assigning someone, or something, a task. It’s about the transference of authority. When Moses handed over leadership to Joshua, he laid hands on him to transfer authority. The same idea applies to animals. The animal has been designated a sacrifice specifically on behalf of its owner. But there is also the transfer of sin. The killing of the animal is a substitute for the death of the worshiper. 

#1 Worship is costly, and #2 Worship is personal. The worshipers did the work. They put their hand on the animal’s head. They were active participants in this. 

```
In Romans 12:1, Paul urges us, “In view of God’s mercy, offer your ___ as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God- this is your ___ and ___ worship.”
```

Leviticus gives a new meaning to that verse. Paul wants us to be consumed with what the Lord wants.

The‘olah (burnt offering) was to ask God to accept the worshiper. It was to draw near God and be at peace with Him. It was a gift.  The smoke that rose to God pleased him because 1) the individual obeyed His commands. The worshiper wasn’t running away; they were drawing near!  2) Peace (shalom) was taking place. God sincerely wants humanity to be at peace with Him. 

(Highlight the purpose of the burnt offering in the above paragraph. Underline the reasons why the smoke pleased God.)

This gift allowed the worshiper, an imperfect person, to approach the most holy and perfect God.

When Abraham was asked to sacrifice Isaac on the altar and burn him up, we know that it was not because of some sin Isaac or Abraham had committed. This was an ‘olah offering. It’s about total surrender and obedience to God. Isaac was replaced by a ram that was caught in the thicket. The sacrifice demonstrated the idea of a ransom so that man could be at peace with God. What was the point of putting Abraham and Sarah through this ordeal? It was to shadow both the future Levitical sacrificial system and Jesus. Ultimately, God the Father took Abraham’s role, and Jesus the Messiah took Isaac’s role. The process was not stopped this time because this was the real deal. God had been preparing this since before He created Adam. 

Each of the offerings we will learn about, teaches us something essential about Christ—both as a person and the work He completed on our behalf. What do you think this first burnt offering teaches us about The Messiah?

The burnt offering shows us Christ as our substitute, and it shows His death.

# Day 2 &middot; _Simply a Steward (The Grain Offering)_

<span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Leviticus 2.

This is the second type of offering. It, too, was burned up on the brazen altar, but it was not blood; instead, it was plant life, specifically grain… or even more specifically, it was semolina, the best part of the grain. It was an offering from the work of your hands. (Here’s a link to how the ancient Israelites baked bread: https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/daily-life-and-practice/biblical-bread-baking-like-the-ancient-israelites/) 

![leviticus ch2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d428ac97-d0c4-472f-8a66-629bbcbde9b5)

This offering was about worship. God provided them with the land and produce, and the worshiper is giving back a portion to the Lord as a thank you.  

Look at www.blueletterbible.org Look up the word for “grain offering” in Leviticus 2:1. What is the word? 

This grain could be offered in several ways: cooked in an oven, on a grill, forming crispy wafers, or in a covered pan—like holy pancakes! Whatever way you cooked it, it needed to be unleavened because nothing containing leaven could ever be burned on the brazen altar. Frankincense and salt could also be added. This would create a pleasant aroma, and then the grain would proceed to smoke. The smoke would rise and please the LORD. 
```
“Every grain offering you bring to the Lord must be made without ____________, for you are not to burn any yeast or ______________ in a food offering presented to the Lord.” (Leviticus 2:11)
```

From our studies in Genesis and Exodus, we know that yeast (or leaven) is the equivalent of ______. (Did you get that one on your own?! If so, bravo!) It is equivalent to sin because leaven causes the bread to ferment and rise. Fermentation corrupts the bread. Once you put leaven into bread, it starts to go bad. 
```
“A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.” (Galatians 5:9)
```

It takes only a little bit to spoil everything. Man, is that ever true? 

Leviticus 2:11 also says not to offer yeast or ___ to the Lord. Why no honey? Pagans often used honey in their sacrifices to their pagan gods to “sweeten” their offerings. Our sacrifice to God should not resemble anything in pagan worship or influence. God doesn’t need us to add anything to what He has prescribed. 

Salt was also added to the dough, and the bread was flavored. When Jesus said, “You are the salt of the earth,” He meant that you are the spice of life. There were no refrigerators then, and salt was a preservative. You preserve God’s values in your culture, family, and own life.  Salt was added to every type of grain offering. All sacrificial offerings were to be salted.

In the ancient Middle East, salt was used to make treaties between two business partners and break a treaty. If a treaty was broken, the consequence was that large volumes of salt would be sprinkled in the offending party’s fields, making them unusable. Yikes! It was also practical because salt is absorbent. It would absorb any extra blood left and then shake it to the ground. The meat needed to be drained of all its blood. Salt would help ensure that no one would eat any blood. The waste salt would then be poured on pathways to keep vegetation from growing. 

The ritual of the grain offering was that the worshiper prepared the dough by one of the prescribed cooking methods or left it uncooked. They brought it to the tabernacle and handed it to the attending priest. The priest would take a handful and put it onto the brazen altar where fire would consume it. This was a small portion. The remainder of the grain offering was given to the priests to be used as their food. They could eat it only on the Tabernacle grounds, as it was a sacred meal. They were dining in God’s presence even though a small amount was taken out, symbolically, that made the entire dough holy. 

```
“If the part of the ___ offered as firstfruits is ___,  then the whole batch is ___; if the root is holy, so are the branches.” (Romans 11:16)
```
Paul is referring to the grain offering, the minchah. He is using the example of the grain offering of the sacrificial system because it was understood by the Jews he was speaking to. They understood that the whole loaf would be holy if a portion were given to God. This is another good reason why knowing the Torah is essential to understanding the New Testament. 

This grain offering was a gift to God; for individuals, it was voluntary, but when the priests offered this on behalf of the nation, it was a tribute. 

Let’s step back a minute. There were two different sacrifices in chapters 1 and 2. The ‘olah was the burning up of animals. The minchah was burning up plant life. The smoke from the sacrifice was the key element. (NOTE: It is essential to know that none of these sacrifices had anything to do with atoning for sins.) The ‘olah was to get God’s attention and to get Him to look favorably on the worshiper. It also brought peace between God and the worshiper. It was a means of reconciliation. Once this was accomplished and the worshiper was put into good standing with God, the grain offering was expressed as being thankful for God’s provision and acknowledging the worshiper’s dedication to the God of Israel. 

When Jesus died, His sacrifice fulfilled the purpose of the olah and the minchah. His death and our faith in Him make us acceptable to God. His death allows us to approach the throne room of God. Does our behavior matter? Of course! Obedience always matters. When we sin and disobey Him, we need to ask for forgiveness. This grain sacrifice was dedicated to God. 

We also bring a gift to God as an act of dedication, “I dedicate myself and my possessions to you, LORD.” We not only feel gratitude, we show it. We not only talk about our dedication, we demonstrate it.

What can you do this week to demonstrate your gratitude for the LORD? ___

We learned of the ‘olah and the minchah. The smoke was a pleasing aroma to God. So, how can you make that applicable? ___

This sacrifice was to say that all I have belongs to God. All that God has given me, all that comes from my labor and hard work, whether in a field or an office, all that the Lord puts into my hands, I am simply a steward of God's blessings. 

What can we learn from this? Simply, all we have belongs to the Lord. All that He has given us, all our abilities, our health, our wealth, our jobs, our hard work (whether in the harvesting fields or the office), all God has put into our hands—we are just a steward of these blessings. So, with what God has blessed us, we will turn around and offer some back to the Lord to fellowship with Him.

So, Leviticus 1 states that blood is shed, giving us access to God, and Leviticus 2 states that we are blessed to make an offering from the work of our hands.

What do you think the grain offering teaches us about The Messiah? ___

Summarize Leviticus 2 as it can apply to your own life.

# Day 3 &middot; _The Fellowship Feast (The Peace Offering)_

<span style="font-size: 1.25em"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>&nbsp; **Read** |</span> Leviticus 3.

Like chapters 1 and 2, this chapter has a pattern. 

Verses 1-5: Peace Offerings of Cattle

Verses 6-11: Peace Offerings of Sheep

Verses 12-17: Peace Offerings of Goats 

Each paragraph follows the same pattern: “If you offer…” (states the tasks the worshiper and priests perform), and ends with “a food offering…pleasing to the LORD.” 

The peace offering was called the Zebah sacrifice. It is an optional offering. It’s only offered if the worshiper feels like it. This sacrificial offering was a peace offering or a fellowship offering. It was not a sacrifice for sin. This sacrifice was slightly less sacred than the first two. In the first two sacrifices, the priests had a prominent role and shared in the sacrificial offering (they kept the skins of the animals and the grain). In this offering, only certain animal parts would be burned up. It could also include male and female animals, but it must be without blemish. Another difference was that the worshippers ate the meat with their family and friends afterward. Part of the sacrifice is burned by fire, part is given to the priest as compensation (the breast and the right thigh), and the rest is taken home for a massive celebration party, celebrating the peace between you and God. This offering is simply something you want to do! How beautiful! 

There is an essential truth in all of these sacrifices. These sacrifices—and all the laws—were only for redeemed people. None of these acts brought redemption. Rather, God first redeemed Israel and gave those people laws and rituals to maintain a relationship with God. It’s the same for us. Our redemption is a free gift. Once we are redeemed, God will explain how we can maintain a relationship with Him. 

This is a peace offering. The Hebrew word for peace is Shalom. To the Hebrews, “peace” meant more than the absence of war. It’s also the word for hello and goodbye. It means peace but so much more. It means satisfaction and well-being, health, prosperity, and peace with God. It’s a word that means I am at peace because I am in the right relationship with God, and I want to take time out to thank Him, praise Him, and enjoy the company of my family and friends. Isn’t this a wonderful idea? God is welcomed into fellowship with us, and we are guests at God’s table.	

There are three types of peace offerings: 

**The confession offering—** when the worshiper sought God for deliverance from his enemies or healing from sickness (Judges 20:24-28 and Judges 21:1-4). He could also offer this sacrifice after he was delivered. 

**The vow offering-** asking God to help you with some problem or to show His mercy for your particular need, and you would pledge to do something for God in return. Jacob made this vow at Bethel. He vowed that if God got him home safe, “the Lord shall be my God” (Genesis 28). When he did return in Genesis 35, he built an altar so he could sacrifice. But Hannah gave the best-known peace or fellowship offering in 1 Samuel 1. When Samuel was weaned, she brought a peace offering to thank God for keeping His promise. 

**The freewill offering-** This one differs from the above in that the worshiper is not seeking anything from God. It is just a spontaneous expression of gratitude to Yahweh. It was a joyful occasion of thanksgiving for God’s goodness, forgiveness, and unexpected generosity. 

These types of peace offerings (zebah) ended with a sacred meal. 

In Acts 21, Paul paid the “expenses” for four men who took a Nazarite vow. He was giving a zebah sacrifice. Now that you know what it is, maybe you will see more examples of this in scripture as you read! 

One more thing about the last verse in chapter 3. It says you must not eat any fat or any blood. The Jehovah’s Witnesses have taken this verse out of context. They believe this even includes a blood transfusion—which is not what it says. Leviticus 17 will explain this further by saying you don’t eat the blood because “the life of the flesh is in the blood.” Even though God is saying not to eat the blood, somehow, in their minds, the blood eventually becomes a part of their body, and a transfusion breaks this commandment. This is a gross misinterpretation of the text. 

How can we apply this offering to our lives? ___

Well, one thing we can do is be more thankful for God's goodness! In fact, we can be celebratory about it! It’s a party…not because it’s someone’s birthday or a holiday, but just because we want to celebrate God’s goodness and faithfulness to us. 

I’d love to encourage you to get together with another family or two this week and have a meal to celebrate that God is a part of our fellowship and our lives! 

Summarize this chapter in one sentence that is meaningful to your life.

# Day 4 &middot; _Unintentional Sin (The Sin Offering)_

All the sacrifices we’ve examined had different purposes and occasions. All of them involved burning an animal or grain on the brazen altar, but none dealt with sins. Instead, they dealt with man’s corrupt nature before God. 

Can you remember the purpose of each of the three sacrifices so far?  Look back on Days 1-3 to fill in the blanks. 


<img width="507" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98375557-70d2-498d-b8ef-088fdda31276">

The burnt offering (‘Olah) allowed the worshiper to “come near” to the Lord, to make them acceptable to approach the Lord. After that, the grain offering (minchah) was a required gift—a ransom—and by doing so, the worshiper expressed his dedication and desire to be obedient. The peace offering (zebah) established a fellowship (a shalom) between God and the worshiper. These three offerings established and maintained peace and fellowship with Yahweh—despite man’s inherent sinful nature. 

Let’s look at some patterns in Leviticus that we should consider. There is a prescribed way we are to deal with a holy God. There are steps we need to follow to approach Yahweh. Sin is present in us, all of us. No one can approach God using a different method or sequence.
