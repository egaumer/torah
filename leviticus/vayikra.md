# Vayikra


The Cloud of Glory, previously on the top of Mount Sinai, has come down and filled the Tent of Meeting. God calls Moses to give him the laws of the sacrifices. Those desiring to draw near to God are told to bring a gift. 

In Judaism today, the book of Leviticus is called “Vayikra,” which means “and He called.” It is taken from Leviticus 1:1. Write that verse down.

In Matthew 16:18, Jesus tells Peter, “And on this rock, I will build my ________, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.” 

The word “church” is ekklēsia. It means “called out.” This message is for us!

On almost every page of this book, God is the direct speaker. The fact that God imparted these laws to Moses is mentioned 56 times in 27 chapters! This book is made up almost entirely of the very words of God…more than any other book of the Bible! 
Leviticus will reveal God's character—and God has not changed. It will also teach us the awfulness of sin and God’s graciousness. It will also introduce us to the sacrifice of Christ and what that means to us. This book will teach us what it truly means to worship the LORD. Are you ready?

# Day 1 &middot; _Worship is Active (The Burnt Offering)_

Millions of people create a New Year’s Resolution every year on New Year's Eve. Did you make one this year? What was it?

A lot of Christians make a resolution to read through the Bible in a year. When they start, it’s great! Genesis is all about beginnings: the beginning of the world, the first family, the first murder, the first city, the first covenant… Wow! It's all good and exciting. Then, Exodus comes on the scene with the themes of freedom and redemption. The Israelites go from the first family to the first nation. They are freed from slavery by miracles of God. They find freedom to worship and journey to the Promised Land. So exciting. But then the “Bible In A Year” hits the book of Leviticus. You have to think, “What is happening here?” Read Leviticus 1.

The offerings given to the Lord in this time were not like those in churches today—when we drop some money into the offering plate as a token of our love for God. Their offerings were time-consuming, significant, bloody, and very, very messy. How does this apply to our lives? We live in a different culture. PETA would advocate for a “Meatless Monday” movement for the entire Israelite community. They might even try to convince the priests of a plant-based offering.

In ancient times, Jewish children began their study of the Bible with the book of Leviticus. It was literally the first book they read! Let that sink in…

As we read this book, we’re not going to get the same “feel-good feels” we get from books like Psalms, Matthew, or John. We’re going to have to dig a little deeper. But precious jewels are worth mining for! So, please put on your mining caps, and let’s begin. 

Something interesting about this book is that nobody moves in it geographically. It opens and closes with the Israelites in the same spot, at Mt. Sinai. Moses has come down from the mountain after having an incredible, personal, holy, and overwhelming worship experience to find God’s people worshiping a golden calf. He loses his mind, becomes angry, smashes the tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written, grinds that golden calf into a de-calf latte, and makes the people drink it.  Then he goes back up the mountain again. He gets a second copy of the law, renews the covenant, and the cloud of God’s shekinah (the presence of God in a place) glory settles over the camp so the people know that God is present. This is where Leviticus begins and ends. 

We call this book “Leviticus,” but the Hebrews called it Vayikra. Does that name sound familiar? It’s the name of this chapter. It means, “And He spoke.” It is the first phrase from this book in verse 1. The Complete Jewish Bible says, "Adonai called to Moshe and spoke to him from the tent of meeting.” We call the book Leviticus after the tribe of Levi, who were the priests. This was the third time that the Torah says God called Moses. (1- Burning bush in Exodus 3, 2- from the midst of the cloud on Mount Sinai in Exodus 19, and 3- here at the beginning of Leviticus.)

The burnt offering of Leviticus 1 is called “‘olah” in Hebrew. It means “that which goes up.” What is going up is smoke.  The offering to the Lord is burned up with a fire on the altar. It emits smoke, which rises to God in heaven. This offering in Chapter 1 is personal: it was made by individuals as opposed to burnt offerings made on behalf of the nation of Israel. 

This offering is completely consumed, totally burned. It all goes to ashes, except for the animal's hide (verse 6). The priests used the hide to make leather goods, clothing, belts, sandals, etc., as part of their compensation. 

In Leviticus 1, what different animals are given as sacrifices? 

What is the reason for so many different animals? There are so many different options. The reason is that the people have varying financial abilities. Somebody with a lot of money can offer a cow. But for someone else, that offering could completely bankrupt them. They may not even have the means to own a cow. So everyone, from the most wealthy to the poorest, can have an offering.
